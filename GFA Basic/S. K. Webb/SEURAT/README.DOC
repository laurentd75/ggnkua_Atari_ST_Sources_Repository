    We've found a couple of glitches in SEURAT which,
fortunately, are easy to work around.

    First, SEURAT will speed up the keyclick rate, so while or
after SEURAT runs it will be difficult to type.  You can fix this
easily by invoking the Control Panel from SEURAT (by
double-clicking on the MENU button and then clicking on Control
Panel under the Desk menu) or from the Desktop or any other
program with a GEM menu bar.  (The Control Panel must be
installed by putting CONTROL.ACC on your boot disk.)  Note that
you do not need to change any of the Control Panel settings;
simply invoking it and then clicking the close button will
restore the keyclick rate to the default.

    Second, we've noticed that SEURAT will occasionally have
trouble freeing up the memory that it used.  If you run SEURAT,
quit, and then run it again later but get an "Out of Memory"
error or don't have as many free paint screens as you did before,
simply reboot the computer.

    We hope you enjoy SEURAT.
