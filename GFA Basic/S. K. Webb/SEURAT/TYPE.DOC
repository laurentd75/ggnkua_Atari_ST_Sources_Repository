     The TYPE.PRG is used to read the User's Manual on  disk,  SEURAT.DOC. 
Think of it as a tutorial driver program.

     TYPE  is intended to replace the "Show" option that appears when  you 
double-click on a non-executable file from the Desktop.

     TYPE  scrolls forward and backward by page or by line and allows  you 
to jump to the end or beginning of a document.  It prints to the screen at 
a rate an order of magnitude faster than the "Show" option.

     TYPE does not buffer input but loads the entire file into memory  and 
formats  the text before displaying it (at 7565 bytes per second).  For  a 
smallish file,  the "Show" option is probably faster to use,  but for  any 
textfile larger than 6kb to 8kb, TYPE pulls ahead!

     Since TYPE.PRG looks  at the basepage,  you can install your .DOC  or 
.LST  or .MSS files as an application for the  TYPE.PRG.  Then,  when  you 
double-click  on  a document,  the TYPE.PRG will take over  and  show  it, 
instead of TOS.

     It is particularly useful when operating in low resolution,  since it 
generates an full 80-column display,  regardless of the resolution at  the 
Desktop level.

      It  has  some limitations.   The length of file it  will  accept  is 
limited by available memory and is determined by the program.  If the file 
you wish to read is too long, an alert will notify you of the maximum file 
size that the program can handle before aborting the read.

     TYPE is configured to deal with a maximum of 2200 lines of  text.  If 
it loads a text file of less than the maximum size that has more than 2200 
lines, it will truncate the file and display the first 2200 lines of text.

     If the file TYPE loads has no carriage return in the first 256 bytes,  
TYPE will abort the read, as a safeguard against trying to display program 
and data files, but the user will be alerted as to the cause.

      TYPE checks the first line of the file to see if that text  line  is 
longer  than 240 characters and aborts (again,  with alert) if it  is.  If 
lines  longer than 80 characters occur in the file,  they will be  doubled 
over (up to 240 characters).

     The specific commands for TYPE.PRG are as follows:
     The up arrow cursor key scrolls the document backward one page.
     The down arrow cursor key scrolls the document forward one page.
     The left arrow cursor key scrolls the document backward one line.
     The right arrow cursor key scrolls the document forward one line.

     Any number key on the keyboard ('1' through '9') scrolls the document 
in  the last previously called direction  and  with an increment  that  is 
multiplied  by  the number keyed.   That is,  if you  have  just  scrolled 
backward  by  one line and you press the 9 key  next,  TYPE   will  scroll 
backward by nine lines.  If you had just paged forward,  pressing the  '9' 
key would jump you ahead by nine pages.

     The <Clr/Home> key jumps to the beginning of the document.
     The <Insert> key jumps to the last page of the document.
     The <Undo> key Quits the read and returns you to GEM Desktop.

     24  lines  are displayed and a command ledger line  appears  at  the 
bottom of each page.

      TYPE  pages  with  an overlap of one  line  to  assure  you  reading 
continuity.   Page  boundaries are not fixed,  but always begin  with  the 
currently displayed screen.
