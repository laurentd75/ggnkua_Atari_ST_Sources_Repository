What's new in HyperGEM ?

Version 1.01               30th May 1994
----------------------------------------

A serious bug managed to creep in which appears when loading a large text
file, outcome of which was either. 
2 bombs - Bus Error, or 3 bombs - Address Error.
This was found to be caused by a memory allocation error and is now fixed.
