     1.   INTRODUCTION.

     HyperGEM is a hierarchical database. It will run on any Atari
     ST in High Resolution 640 by 400.

     The minimum memory requirements are 1 meg machines due to the
     memory requirements in converting  colour pictures into their
     monochrome equivalents.

     It is designed to  allow  you  to  structure information in a
     logical way. Data is arranged in a series of 'Windows', which
     contain either Text or  Graphics.  Areas  of  the Windows are
     designated as 'Buttons', which when clicked on with the mouse
     pointer, bring up further windows.  In  this way, a branching
     tree of windows is formed.

     This  technique  lends  itself   to  many  uses:  Referencing
     Information, Diagnostic  Systems,  Expert  Systems,  and even
     Teaching programs.


     2.   GETTING STARTED.

     To  start   the   program,   double   click   on   the   file
     'HYPERGEM.PRG', which  will  load  and  display  a  'HyperGEM
     Initialising' message and then a GEM Menu Bar.

     The menu options are  discussed  later,  but  for an example,
     move the mouse pointer up to the 'File' heading, and click on
     'Load  HyperSystem'  option.  When  the  file  selection  box
     appears, select the file 'DEMO.HYP'  and once the demo system
     has loaded, move the pointer  up  to  the 'File' heading, and
     click on 'Run HyperSystem'. A Graphic Window will appear with
     a button labelled 'Contents', a click within this button will
     make another window appear, and so  on.  To go back a window,
     click on the close window box at  the top left hand corner of
     each window.


     3.   WINDOW HANDLING.

     By clicking on the  close window icon in the top left of each
     window, you can go back to  the parent of each window, unless
     you are at the root window.

     By clicking and holding the resize  window icon at the bottom
     right of the window, you can resize the window.

     By clicking on full  window  icon  at  the  top  right of the
     window you can open  the  current  window  to  its full size,
     clicking on the icon  again  will  restore  the window to its
     previous size.

     The contents of every window may  be scrolled by dragging the
     scroll bar within its box  or  by  clicking above and below a
     slider box, or by  clicking  on  the  window arrow icons. The
     slider bars are positioned  on  the  right  middle and bottom
     middle of a window.

     If there  are  any  buttons  on  the  window,  they  will  be
     displayed as  lines  on  text  windows  or  boxes  with  text
     contained within them. By clicking on a newly drawn button, a
     dialog box will appear allowing the  user to select what type
     of event will be linked to it.


     4.   DESK MENU.

     Under the desk menu is  the choice 'Information on HyperGEM',
     which displays the  version  and  author  details. Also under
     this menu is any desk accessories you may have installed. All
     these function as normal.


     5.   THE FILE MENU.

     The  file  menu  provides   the   user  with  five  important
     HyperSystem operations and these are the following :

     5.1  Generate HyperSystem.
     5.2  Run HyperSystem.
     5.3  Load HyperSystem.
     5.4  Save HyperSystem.
     5.5  Quit Program.


     5.1  GENERATE HYPERSYSTEM.

     Clicking on the  'Generate  HyperSystem'  option  removes any
     existing HyperSystem from memory and allows the user to start
     a new HyperSystem.

     After a few seconds the user is given the option of loading a
     graphic or loading a  text  file  which  will  be used as the
     first (node) window.


     5.2  RUN HYPERSYSTEM.

     Clicking on the  'Run  HyperSystem'  option  will execute the
     loaded or the  generated  HyperSystem  from  the (root) first
     window.


     5.3  LOAD HYPERSYSTEM.

     Clicking on the 'Load  HyperSystem'  option  brings up a file
     selector box. Choosing a  system  will  load  it, erasing the
     system currently in memory.


     5.4  SAVE HYPERSYSTEM.

     Clicking on the 'Save  HyperSystem'  option  will  bring up a
     file selection box.

     This will allow the  user  to  select an existing HyperSystem
     which will be updated and the  old version will be renamed to
     '.BAK'.

     Or it will allow the  user  to  type  in  a new filename with
     which the current HyperSystem will be saved under.


     5.5  QUIT PROGRAM.

     Clicking on the 'Quit Program' option  will allow the user to
     quit the program and return to the desktop.

     If the HyperSystem has been added  to or some windows removed
     and these alterations have not  been  saved  then the user is
     given the option to save  his  work  before the system closes
     down completely.


     6.   THE WINDOW MENU.

     The window  menu  provides  the  user  with  three  important
     HyperSystem button operations and these are the following :

     6.1  Add Button.
     6.2  Modify Button.
     6.3  Erase Button.


     6.1  ADD BUTTON.

     When you select this  option,  and  the  current  window is a
     graphic window, a dialog box will appear allowing the user to
     type in a name for the  button.  By clicking and holding with
     the left hand  button  you  may  position  the  button in the
     window.

     When you select this option, and the current window is a text
     window, use the pointer to draw  a button onto the window, by
     clicking and holding with  the  left  hand  button on the top
     left hand corner of the  button,  and releasing on the bottom
     right.


     6.2  MODIFY BUTTON.

     If you misplace a button, or you edit the text and the button
     is no longer in the correct  position, this option allows you
     to relocate it. Click  on  the  button  you  wish to replace,
     which will then disappear, then draw  a  new button on in the
     normal way  (see  Add  Button).  All  connections  and  other
     buttons remain intact.


     6.3  ERASE BUTTON.

     Clicking on the button you wish to delete, this option allows
     you to remove  a  button.  But  be  warned  this  option also
     removes all windows linked to this button, so use this option
     with some caution.


     7.   THE BUTTON EVENTS.

     Once a button is  pressed  one  of  the  following events can
     occur :-

     7.1  A Graphic file will be displayed.
     7.2  A Text file will be displayed in the Editor.
     7.3  A Digital Sound Sample file will be played.


     7.1  GRAPHIC FILES.

     Graphics importation, the program  will allow the importation
     of the following graphic formats available on the Atari ST:

     PI1  Degas Elite Low Resolution Uncompressed.
     PC1  Degas Elite Low Resolution Compressed.
     PI3  Degas Elite High Resolution Uncompressed.
     PC3  Degas Elite High Resolution Compressed.
     TN1  Tiny Low Resolution Compressed.
     TN3  Tiny High Resolution Compressed.
     IMG  GEM Image High Resolution Compressed.

     The program will  automatically  convert  colour  images into
     their monochrome  equivalents.  The  loaded  graphic  will be
     allowed to be scrolled  within  the  window using slider bars
     and window arrow buttons.


     7.2  TEXT FILES.

     The program supports  the  following  text  file  formats and
     identifies them automatically from their file extensions.

     ASC  ASCII Text Files.


     THE TEXT EDITOR.

     The Text Editor allows you to  add and delete text, just like
     any other text editor. The  keys which are operational, apart
     from the ordinary character keys are:

     BACKSPACE      Delete the character behind the cursor.
     DELETE         Delete the current character.
     INSERT         Change to INSERT or OVERWRITE mode.
     RETURN         Perform a carriage return.
     ESCAPE         Save the current edited file.
     CURSOR KEYS    Work as usual.


     7.3  DIGITAL SOUND SAMPLE FILES.

     Sample  importation  of  the  most  widely  available  sample
     formats available on the Atari ST. The following file formats
     are supported:

     DVSM      Atari Falcon Format.
     SND       Sun, Mac, NeXT.
     WAVE      IBM PC & Compatiables.
     AVR       Many Atari ST/Falcon programs.


     8.   APPENDIX.

     HyperGEM was written in  GFA  Basic  over  a  period of about
     three months, and then compiled  with  the GFA Basic Compiler
     v3.6e. The program is designed  to  be  foolproof - but there
     actually is not such a thing and so problems can arise.

     I hope I have  included  enough  options, and documented them
     well enough to rectify any problems, if there are any serious
     bugs or improvements you  you  feel  should  be  added to the
     program, then  feel  free  to  contact  me  at  the following
     address :

     This program will continue to  be  improved and upgraded. The
     next version will be written in  Lattice C which handles data
     structures more flexibly the  only  restriction  in Lattice C
     will be available memory.
