@{0U}                                  Installation and system requirements@{0}

  16 colors 640*400 pixels screen is the minimum required.

  A modern operating system such as MagiC or MiNT is strongly advised,
  with an optimized VDI like NVDI.

  Requires the "EdDI" cookie to display on graphic cards.
  Falcon and new machines such as Milan have this by nature.
  If you have a graphic card with an old operating system, you'll need NVDI.
 
  The program uses plenty of memory, moreover on high-colored screens.
  So if you have not enough space or if the game becomes slower, run
  it in 640*480 16 colors.

  ST-Guide installation is required if you want to call the
  documentation directly from the program. Make it as *.ACC or
  declare its path in the environment variable STGUIDE$.
  ie in MAGX.INF, #_ENV STGUIDE=C:\ST-GUIDE.ACX

   @{0U}Use cache for converted images to screen format@{0}
     This option is set by default. At first start, saves the cache
     after images loading and convertion. 
     Next start, if found and corresponding to the screen pixel format
     and bitplane number, the software will load the XIMAGES.nnn and
     XIMAGES.IDX instead of loading and converting (for a long time)
     the original DGX images files. If the screen format is the same.
     This speed up program start up.

   @{0U}Image cache@{0}
     The software will write the converted images in this folder.

   @{0U}Use a desk background@{0}
     The software will install its own desk background.
     Can be nicer in the 16/256 colors modes and under 
     a multitasking environement.

   @{0U}Main window size@{0}
     A zoom can be applied on the view window.
     This option uses some enhancements appeared with NVDI (see NVDI4 docs).
     Unfortunatly, it's slow and does not work with graphics cards
     and some NVDI versions.
     If not available, a built-in function can zoom for True Color screens.

   @{0U}Hide mouse cursor if game windows ontop@{0}
     Mouse cursor may be not needed ingame, and its flickering may be annoying.
     Cursor is shown if game is paused.

   @{0U}Use Offscreen VDI functions@{0} (need restart)
     If available ("EdDI" cookie) and set, opens an offscreen VDI bitmap and
     uses this handle. May speed up animations on some configurations such as
     Milan+NVDI. 
     Carefull, it may also slow display on standard machines.
     Due to some bugs, text display uses the on-screen VDI handle.
              
   @{0U}Allocates in Video RAM@{0} (need restart)
     If available (Radeon card on PCI, SuperVidel), this option is unhidden 
     and set on to use ct60_vmalloc(). This relocates graphics datas in
     Video RAM to speed up animations.
     It this options appears disabled, the VRAM allocation has failed.
      
   You cannot yet use these display options together.

   @{0U}Enable (Falcon compatible) sound@{0}
     The software will use the XBIOS sound routines appeared with the
     Falcon TOS. If you want to enable the sound on other computer than a
     Falcon, you may install for:

     ú Atari STE or TT, or an Atari emulator which
       supports DMA Sound, then use Thomas Huth's XSound
       (put the XSND_DMA.PRG in the AUTO folder, see in
       the GOODIES folder of DGEM archive).

     ú Milan: use the MilanBlaster driver (commercial)

     ú Hades: use GSXB from Assemsoft (freeware)

     ú Aranym: use zmagxsnd.prg and use correct audio parameters 
       in Aranym config file
             
     Note: under MiNT with Memory Protection mode, set the program header flag
     to 'Super' or 'Global' for the DMA sounds to be played without crash.

   @{0U}Maximum volume@{0}
     The software will attenuate sound output.
 
   @{0U}SNDH music@{0}
     Need a Yamaha PSG or compatible. May be crashy.
     This feature is disable on ColdFire setup.

   @{0U}SNDH file@{0}
     Choose a *.SND file that will be played ingame.
