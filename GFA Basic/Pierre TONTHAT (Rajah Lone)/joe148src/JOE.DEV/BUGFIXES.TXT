Joe 1.48 bugfix releases :

BugFix 1:
- Custom text macros (Alt+Key) validation (thks T.LEROY)
- Added a missing &Aring;
- small bugfixes

Bugfix 2:
- Big bug that was unseen or made Joe to crash (thks A.BERCEGEAY)
- Correctly read AES version now (thks J.HATLAK)
- Improved horizontal scrolling behaviour (but not as perfect as I wanted)
- Understanding GEMScript command : setCursorAt(column, line) (line is optionnal)
- Sending GEMScript command to modules : hasClosed(filename)
- Added in the JXM file the key "EXEC=", value is module path and filename.
  (if the module is not in the \MODULES\ folder, Joe will launch it with this value)
- small bugfixes
- tried to correct menu and dialog slowliness under MiNT but failed (sorry Bohdan)

Bugfix 3:
- fixed a big crash during communication between Joe and its modules
- Hope to have corrected the menu and dialog box slowliness under MiNT
- use of XRSC for external ressource files (RGF method), if you have
  problems with it, rename the \MODULES\XRSRC.OVL as *.OVX.
- keyboard overrun behavior improvement
- some internal small bugfixes

- Well formed HTML. You have seen that Joe use in its menus and
modules well formed HTML, for exemple <IMG />. This management is
by default in Joe environment. This is required when you write XSL/XML
and XHTML. If you don't want <IMG /> but the old <IMG>, save and edit
the new JOE.CFG file and change the key "USE_WELL_FORMED_HTML" to "FALSE".

- ISO-8859-1 filter new function activated by default. If you don't
want it (seen imperfections or want of speed), save and edit the new
JOE.CFG and change the key "ISO-8859-1_FILTER" from "TRUE" to "FALSE".

The filter is working at loading (and merging, pasting) only if the META tag
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">
or the <?xml version="1.x" encoding="iso-8859-1"?> is there in the first
2048 bytes.
If success: the ISO chars are converted to Atari chars
If not: the character are not converted

The filter is working at saving (and cutting, copying) only if the same META
or XML tag is in the first 32 lines of the text.
If success: the Atari chars are converted to ISO chars
If not: all is unchanged

The convertion between ISO and Atari charset is no strictly bijective,
so some characters will be converted to &#NNN; where NNN is the ISO
value.

Bugfix 4:
- fixed crash at launch under MiNT with Memory Protection


Please report any bug you've found.
