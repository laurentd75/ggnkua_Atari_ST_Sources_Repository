  KK Commander is a Total-Commander mock-up for Atari, monoTOS or
  MagiC or even MiNT with Memory Protection
  Suited for small configurations: since 1 MB RAM and 320*200.

  - files/folders manipulations
  - basic program launcher
  - file opening by AVSERVER
  - convenient navigation with keyboard

  - floppy disk format

  - floppy disks images managment (.MSA et .ST)
      - generating .MSA from floppy disk
      - format and write .MSA or .ST to floppy disk
      - browse .MSA or .ST as if it was a folder
      - file extraction from the image disk to a true disk

  - split/unsplit …-la-Total-Commander

  - PKZIP archives management (.ZIP)
      - generating empty zip file
      - browse .ZIP as if it was a folder
      - add files, with STORE or DEFLATE method. if a same filename,
        the old zipentry is deleted, replaced by the new one.
      - extract files, with RESTORE or INFLATE method

      for DEFLATE and INFLATE, you need to install the LDG system
      that is a set of gem librairies. See http://ldg.atari.org


      @{0B}Carefull: STZIP has problems to inflate files deflated with KKcmd
      If you want to spread public archives, I suggest you to keep STZIP, or
      tell to use KKcmd or unzippers from the zlib.

      General caution with STZIP: do not modify an archive with it because
      it may corrupt the archive. So create one, add files, but don't modify.@{0}

      I'm trying to be compatible with STZIP, but failed for now. I'll try
      for the next releases of KKcmd.

    The program is freeware and its spread is granted.

    As always, the program is released "as is". The soft runs
    on our system with some @{"limitations" LINK "manga_bogues"}, but we deny any responsability
    concerning the damages this soft could make to yours.

  @{0U}Needs at least:@{0}

  ú 1 Mo free RAM (TT-RAM is used if existing)
  ú a modern VDI is advised

  @{0U}Install:@{0}

  ú Copy the KKCMD.PRG and KKCMD.RSC (and eventually KKCMD.HYP)
    besides, in the same directory, on an hard disk or floppy disk
    if enough available space.
  ú ST-Guide should be installed and $STGUIDE environment variable
    set to read the documentation.

  ú To zip or unzip with DEFLATE method, the program needs a GEM library
    called DEFLATE.LDG, and the LDGM cookie to find it.

    From the GOODIES folder of this release, copy:

    C:\AUTO\LDG.PRG (or your AUTO folder)
    C:\GEMSYS\LDG\MEM.LDG
    C:\GEMSYS\LDG\DEFLATE.LDG (needs MEM.LDG for its mallocs)
    C:\CPX\LDG.CPX (or your CPX folder)

  If you want to use it as an alternative desktop, it requires GEM
  so with TOS >= 1.4 and GEM autostart method (not in AUTO folder, but
  declared in the DESKTOP.INF)

  ú Some security lacks in the disk operations: old GFA open file is
    made with INF files. So be carefull if the program is installed
    on a removeable media.

  ú partialy incompatible with STZIP, for now:
    STZIP has errors inflating the files deflated with KKcmd.

  @{0B}1.4G@{0}
  - fix:
    - new method for free space disk. The old method was not adapted for large disk spaces
      such as Aranym HOSTFS, files could not be extracted, copied or moved if the option
      'verify remaining space disk' was set.

  @{0B}1.4F@{0}
  - fix:
    - buffers increased for MSA made on HD floppies (18 to 21 sectors per track)

  @{0B}1.4E@{0}
  - fixes:
    - memory corruption if MSA had 13 sectors per track or more
    - font height correctly saved in the display configuration

  @{0B}1.4D@{0}
  - fixes:
    - empty list in some MSA or ST file (some floppy disk formators write 0 instead of 1 in the reserved sectors)
    - folder contents are now extracted from the MSA or ST (bad pointer, sorry)
  + if mouse click in a blank part of the window, if no item selected, then activate the window
  + try to keep slider position of the parent directory
  Merci to Sascha UHLIG

  @{0B}1.4C@{0}
  - fixes:
    - trying to keep position inside window files list, after a dir or files manipulation
    - better file selection if it was not yet selected (if no mouse movement, then selection and
    drag'n'drop, instead of grabbox for multi-selection)
    - pop-ups sliders redraw problem, under XaAES: 1 pixel larger.
  Merci … O.Landemarre et JF.Lemaire

  @{0B}1.4B@{0}
  - fixes:
    - if extension, bad spaces removed in new empty file or folder
    - if .ZIP opened, the window contents (but not the .ZIP file) was cleared, if
      file deletion in the other window
    - size of grabbox (copy or move files) is more adapted if more than one selected items
    - didn't keep date when unzipping (if option 'keep date' was selected)
  + add: .MSA and .ST files in command line: opened at start (.ZIP was already managed)
  + add: VA_START protocol for .MSA .ST and .ZIP files

  @{0B}1.4@{0}
  + less memory use (moreover if the list of files to transfer is long)
  + PKZIP archive files management (.ZIP files)
    + with log file, to avoid repetitive blocking alerts
    + deflate level in misc options
    + empty .ZIP creation
    + browse like a normal directory
    + add empty folder
    + delete of zip entries
    + add new entries, extraction to files, with methods
      STORE or DEFLATE.
      for DEFLATE, you need to install the DEFLATE.LDG with
      MEM.LDG, that are gem librairies <http://ldg.atari.org>
    (Thanks to pmdata, mmu_man, #jagware)

  @{0B}1.3@{0}
  + ST-Guide documentation
  + iconification
  + use of AVSERVER to open non-executable files
  + Ctrl+S = save preferences ad paths
  + '…-la-Total-Commander' file selection: red or gris‚,
  when playing with keys, a framing cursor is used.
  + the 'Insert' key selects the file/folder under the cursor
    (Merci MiKRO)
  + split file like in Total Commander
  + unsplit file (double-click on .CRC file)
    split/unsplit results are created in the opposite window.
    (Thanks Dbug/NeXT)

  @{0B}1.2@{0}
  - fix: when copying/moving, correct dates of files and folders
  - fix: when already existing formular - exit click and Enter works
  - fix: better disk informations (Ctrl+I)
  In icons list, on A or B:
  + floppy disk format
  + floppy disk quick format (FAT erase, keeping bad sectors positions)
  + convert floppy disk to .MSA file (with RLE compression)
  In files list, on .MSA or .ST file:
  + can open a floppy disk image as if it was a folder (delay of work
    if compressed .MSA file), can walk throught folders and list files.
  + can copy those folders and files to a real folder/disk (ie file
  extraction from .MSA or /ST file).
  Thanks Frost242 and Zerosquare

  @{0B}1.1C@{0}
  - fix: column positions correctly saved/read
  - fix: font height correctly saved/read
  - add .APP as launchable
  - F2: swap windows contents and new dir

  @{0B}1.1B@{0}
  - fix: correct options if right-click/pop-up menu in disks list
  - confirm is now by default, in the copy/move formular
  - space: no more swap windows, now select file under the mouse pointer

  @{0B}1.1@{0}
  - disk list (with icons, up in the partition root or use Alt+F1/F2)
  - font size can be choosen (of none selected, then default size)
  - some changes in the key shortcuts (taken from similar programs,
  careful, the GEM shortcuts prevail)
  (Merci Didier, Dma-Sc et Arklif)

  @{0B}1.0D@{0}
  - force mouse cursor display when returning from other program
  (monoTOS only)
  - arrows window scrolling fix for newer AES
  (Merci … GokMasE and Didier LETOT)

  @{0B}1.0C@{0}
  - removed unnecessary code
  - if right-click on unselected file, select it. If a selection
  alrealdy exists, no effects.
  - mouse selection with rubberbox (initiate it on an unselected file).
  - Control key detected also at the end of drag'n'drop (for files moves)
  - Alternate key detected with mouse click (select one file, then
  select another + Alt key pressed)
  - radio buttons correctly read in the confirmation dialogbox for
  copying/moving files.

  @{0B}1.0B@{0}
  - MiNT Memory Protection compatibility (no more crash at start, at
  least. remove of RESERVE at initialization)
  - remove of LPEEK for TOS version detection
  - some minor changes in the RSC for ergonomic purposes
  - mouse button right click = click on the button "~"

  @{0B}1.0@{0}
