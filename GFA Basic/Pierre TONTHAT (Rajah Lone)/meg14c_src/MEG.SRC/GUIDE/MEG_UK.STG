@{0U}What Meg does?                                                        @{0}

 @{0B}Meg@{0} is a small program for checking POP3 mailboxes and
 filtering spam or other unwanted mails.

 Meg runs on Atari computers, emulators or clones under TOS, MagiC
 or MiNT (>= 1.17.0).

  @{0U}Features:@{0}

  ú looks automatically in several mailboxes you have declared
    (use of pop3 protocol).
  ú can use secure connection with the library POLARSSL.LDG (MiNTnet only
    for now) and use POP3S or POP3 with STLS.
  ú counts the mails received.
  ú discards or deletes the spam with some rules you have given.
    and writes some infos in a log file.
  ú if the mail comes from a declared friend, the mail is always accepted.
  ú can import email addresses from TROLL's datalist.
  ú warns you in its iconified window, a message in AtarIRC, or a sound alert.
  ú launches the email client, if mail has been detected, with
    a single click on the iconified window (MagiC). Under MiNT,
    uniconify the window and click the button, or just top the
    iconified window and press space key.

@{0U}Install and requirements                                              @{0}

 @{0U}Meg needs:@{0}

 ú A multitasking environment is stronly advised, with iconification
   support. An AV Server or MagiC is needed to watch the log file or
   listen the sound alert.

 ú STinG TCP/IP layer is advised under TOS or MagiC.
   MiNTnet is used under MiNT, but GlueSTiK is still needed for the
   name resolver.

 @{0U}Installation:@{0}

 > Copy MEG.APP and MEG.RSC together in the same folder.
   The DATAS folder may be located beside the PRG file.

 > Launch MEG.APP and goto the preferences to set the location of
   the DATAS folder, choose the names of the files, etc.

 > In your desktop program, you should link the *.AVR or *.WAV sound
   alert file to an application (ie GEMJing), same with the
   *.LOG file (ie EvereST).

 > Secure connections are supported pour le POP3 : POP3S ou POP3 with STLS.
   You need the POLARSSL.LDG library.
   For now, only with MiNTNet TCP layer.
  
   LDG.PRG must be launched (in AUTO folder or manualy after) to add the
   LDGM cookie.
   These files must be located in the LDG folder (usualy C:\GEMSYS\LDG\):
   - POLARSSL.LDG (mandatory)
   - POLARSSL.CA (optional, for servers certificates verification)
   These files are provided in a separate archive "POLARSSL.ZIP".

   - "?" button: Modify a selected entry.
   - "-" button: Delete a selected entry.

  Additonal buttons in filter dialog:
   - The "" and "" buttons modify the order of the

@alabel meg_mailcheck
  - @{0U}Check@{0}
    Click on this button to check all mailboxes for new emails.
    The emails (if any) are filtered and number of emails is
    displayed in main window, iconified window and in
    mailbox window (seperately for each mailbox).

    If BubbleGEM (or XaAES bubble help) is installed, number and
    size of emails are displayed in a help bubble when you move
    the mouse over the iconified window.

    All filter actions are saved in logfile (if activated
    in preferences).

    The same happens if "Check mailboxes every xx minutes" is
    activated in preferences.

  - @{0U}Launch Mail Client@{0}
    A click on this button starts the email client (path must be
    set in preferences).
    If the email client is already running, button "Check" and the
    automatic mailbox checking is deactivated.

  @{0U}Notes:@{0}

    - at first, do not delete the mails that seem spams.
      Use the filters with care, see the log file and
      learn to add correct rules.
      If you note a lack of rule or want it more subtle,
      please mail me.

    - remember the mail address are formated as
      "name <user@@domain>", so you can use the @@, < and >
      chars to your rule, such as ".kr>" for spams
      coming from Korea.

    - the mails number for each mailbox is displayed in the
      mailbox window after the first detection.

    - the first part of the body mail is read to search
      for a 'denial' string, but attention, the body is not
      converted if it's sent in Base64 or quoted-printable
      (can be converted in the future if needed).

    - if you delete 'HTML only' mails, put this filter as
      first: The scan will be very quick ;)

    - if you use 'To + Cc is not for me' and you username
      for your mailbox is not the same as your real email
      address: Put your correct email address in the friends
      table (with the correct type).

    - if you use 'To + Cc is not for me' and mailing-lists,
      declare these mailing-lists in the friends table
      (with the correct type).

 The filtering can be indicative or deleting; by default, Meg checks
 the mailboxes for new mails and writes the results to logfile.

 With option "Delete mails discarded by the filters" activated,
 Meg checks the mailboxes, filters the emails and deletes the
 filtered emails directly on the server.

 To create filters, select "Windows/Filters" in menu or press
 CTRL+K keys.
 A click on '+' button opens a dialog to create a new filter.

 First you can select which part of an email/message shall be
 scanned, textfield "From", "To+Cc", "Subject", "Body" or "Size".
 There are different search criterias for each of this parts.

 Additionally you can select if that filter is specific for only
 one Server.

 Click on "Add" (Modify) button to commit the entries/changes,
 then the new filter is listed in filter window.

  @{0B}1.4C@{0}
    - fix: works now as before in ACCessory mode under MagiC and monoTOS
           (thanks to a fix in Lonny Pursell's Library).
    - fix: crash under monoTOS 1.4 at start 
           (G_CICON must not be changed, even its text).
    - add: wrong CPU alert (FATAL test).
    - chg: ERR=8 test for available memory at start.

  @{0B}1.4B@{0}
    - fix: possible crash at start, when loading the preferences file.
    - fix: removed unnecessary MiNTnet calls when opening connection with the
           server. These calls made the connection opened even if the server
           was unavailable.
    - fix: crash if POP3 command could be sent because the server has closed
           the connection (or became unavailable).

  @{0B}1.4@{0}
    - add: SSL/TLS support with the POLARSSL.LDG library.
           - POP3S or POP3 with STLS
           - server certificate check (disabled by default)
    - add: in friends table, can import TROLL's emails addresses.
    - chg: preferences reorganized into panels.
    - chg: reorganized menu, the guide can still be called with the Help key.
    - fix: windows arrowed were not working under XaAES.
    - fix: internal menu wasn't displayed under MagiC.
    - fix: internal menu titles weren't deselected sometimes under XaAES.
    - fix: search in cookie jar more respectful to the system.

  @{0B}1.3D@{0}
    - fix: log file was filled with bad content.
    - fix: editable fields disabled/enabled in Filters editor window.
    - fix: work-around for MiNT, to launch the mail client in the
           iconified window, top this window and press space. 
    Thanks to Lars SCHMIDBAUER

  @{0B}1.3C@{0}
    - chg: usage of AES extensions for internal menu
           (WF_MENU with wind_set()).
    - fix: modifications in RSC file for XaAES.
    - fix: use of AES GRAF_MOUSE instead of VDI for
           hide/show mouse cursor.

  @{0B}1.3B@{0}
    - fix display in iconified window under MyAES.

  @{0B}1.3@{0}
    - recompiled with Lonny Pursell's GFA Library, with 68000 and
      Coldfire targets.
    - code cleaning and rewrite of the preferences load function.
    - smart name for display in taskbars.
    - direct use of MiNTnet TCP/layer (GlueSTiK is still needed
      but only for the resolver function).
    - passwords are masqued for display (uncrypted in the datafile).
    - username field is enlarged (mailboxes datafile is
      automaticaly converted).

  @{0B}1.2F@{0}
    - fix crash at launch under MiNT with Memory Protection

  @{0B}1.2E@{0}
    - 'Bcc' removed for the search
    - while scanning: mail counter (in status)
    - while scanning: redraws and pause between each mail
    - with mailserver: cleaner connection closing
    - non-modal windows with copy/paste functions
    - new 256 colors icon in the iconified window

  @{0B}1.2D@{0}
    - added 'Reply-To' and 'Bcc' for the search
    - new friend type: own email address (in case the username
                       of the mailbox is different from the email)
    - scan is desactivated while the mail client is running
    - new POP3 receive routine (quicker, maybe less freezing)
    - bugfix of the iso8859->atari conversion routine
    - bugfix of size(s) of mail(s) announced
    - more memory for analysis
    (Thanks Kenneth ;))

  @{0B}1.2C@{0}
    - bugfix of 'From', 'To', 'Subject', etc detection failure if
      they were in major case (fool trick of spams). Detection of the
      fields of the mail header is now case unsensitive. With this bug,
      the spams were always accepted if some friends were declared.
      (Thanks Kenneth ;))

  @{0B}1.2B@{0}
    - bugfix of filter 'case sensitive' string search in Body
    - bugfix of freeze if authentification has failed
    - work-around for $HOME on MiNT ext2 partition (save the MEG.INF
      beside the program if it cannot write in $HOME folder)

  @{0B}1.2@{0}
    - bugfix of 'Save' item menu : now active
    + alert to save datas when leaving (if datas have been modified)
    - bugfix in 'To + Cc' string search (was searching only in 'To')
    + optionnal case sensitivity for string search
    + new type of 'friend' : mailing-list (Email3 is deprecated)
      -> declare a mailing-list, so you can use the 'To + Cc' is not for me
         and keep mails coming from this mailing-list
    + New size filter : range of size (>=X and <=Y). If you want to delete
         all mail with size (>=X), use only the first numeric field.
    + Spam size is notified in the log file
    + Total size of mails is indicated in a bubble upon the icon
      (only if bubble deamon is set)

  @{0B}1.1@{0}
    - bugfix of 'To' and 'Reply-To' field confusion
    - bugfix of several lines field detection (both tab and space)
    + new parameter : number of lines of mail body to retrieve for analyse
    + accessory mode (with no guarantee on stability, prefer APP mode in
      multitasking environment)
    + new filter : mail size
    + new notification type : in AtarICQ window
    + new notification type : system bell

  @{0B}1.0B@{0}
    - bugfix of "Cc" (Carbon copy) field read. Wasn't reading
      the next lines and mail addresses
    - bugfix of body mail read. Could cause a crash or a program freeze

  @{0B}1.0@{0}
    + first release, based on the study of Kellis' POPGEM.
