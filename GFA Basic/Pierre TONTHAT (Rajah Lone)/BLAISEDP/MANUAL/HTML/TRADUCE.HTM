I have done my best to make Blaise program easy to traduce. The only thing which is
to be changed for others languages is the RSC file.
<P>
The RSC will be edited with RSC editor such as INTERFACE, WERCS or RSC3. You can modify all
text save the program informations ("About the..."). But be carefull to respect the objects
order. You can put your name in the "Information" window-dial next the last object.<BR>
Please do not change the state or flags of the objects.<BR>
<P>
<b>IMPORTANT&nbsp;:</b><BR>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=5><TR><TD>As you well know, keyboards are not the same. The
Control+Key works without restriction form a
country to another, but not the Alternate+Key. Therefore, for the text macro, you have to
modify specifically someting in the RSC file&nbsp;: you will see in the "d&eacute;finir les
macros" an image of the keyboard.<BR>Modify it to correspond to the keyboard of your language.
Use major case letter (A to Z) and respect above all the order of the objects&nbsp;: reSort
them to have a new key map. All that is not A to Z is considered as dead key.</TD></TR></TABLE>
