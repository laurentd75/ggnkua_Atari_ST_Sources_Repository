Rage Screen Saver 1.1B

This software is freeware. Its sources are provided for
general knowlegde in the same archive. Adaptations and
upgrades without the agreement of the author are permited.

This software is a 'hard' screen saver for the ATI Mach64
series graphic cards. The display of the card is put off
after a delay of inactivity.
Only mouse clicks and movements are monitored (problems with
reading keyboards inputs, since no AES function exists).

It was coded in GFA Basic for my Falcon+Eclipse/ATI RageIIc
and Sony M-51 (15' TFT screen), it may work on others systems,
though without guaranty.
It needs:
- video card of ATI Mach64 family (inquire PCI card function)
- PCI Bios implementation

Attention : USE THIS PROGRAM AT YOU OWN RISK.

I deny any responsability of the usage of this software.
So be carefull on repeated blanks with your monitor.
The screen saver must be employed to save your monitor
in a period of inactivity, not to destroy it by
blanking and unblanking with shorts delays.
So use a value > 10 minutes.

New in the 1.1 version:
- bugfixes
- delay of 7s for the blank test (was bug : didn't wait
the mouse to move, so the blank was too quick)
+ launch of one of the VDI_FX, only under MagiC, that
makes a 'soft' screen saver before the 'hard' one.

New in the 1.1B version:
- fixed crah at launch under MiNT with Memory Protection
