@{0U}What Iphig‚nie does?                                                      @{0}

    Iphig‚nie is a Sound System Monitor for the Atari Falcon030. It looks
    every seconds the sound configuration and the matrix, and shows them
    in its main window.

    All the matrix connections and the sound settings can be changed by
    clicking an item in the window.
    IMPORTANT: @{0B}the one who doesn't know how his Falcon sound card
    works should not modify the settings!@{0}

    Since 1.4 version, the user can see and set the matrix details :
    handshake mode (securized transferts), original clock and frequencies
    for every matrix data source.
    Carefull: the software is not coded to detect an external clock. You
    must declare it in the preferences if you have connected one.
    The value you declare is only used for the frequency display.
    Iphig‚nie doesn't manage external clocks, present or not, but only
    its connection to the matrix.


@{0U}Control the Sound System@{0}

    Some functions can lock/unlock the Sound System and the DSP, reset
    Sound System, and can do a shutdown on sound (with the main shutdown).

    The DSP can be reset for cleaning, or when an application using it
    has crashed. Use this reset moderatly.


@{0U}Load and save the sound configuration@{0}

    The sound configurations can be loaded and saved in a text file with
    IPH extension. Do not edit it, use only Iphig‚nie with them.
    The DEFAULT.IPH (located in a folder defined in the settings and paths)
    can be loaded at every Iphig‚nie launch.

    A sound configuration can have a LOD file. By loading a IPH file (and
    setting the option for), the LOD file is automaticaly loaded and run
    by the DSP.


@{0U}Load and execute a LOD file@{0}

    You can load a LOD file in the DSP memory and make it execute these
    binaries. Iphig‚nie doesn't know the memory consommation so it
    flushes all subroutines and tells the OS and DSP to execute the LOD
    file. The DSP nor the Sound System aren't locked, so important programs
    such as Studio Son can be launched without alerts

    The LOD files we're talking about are for the sound processing:
    those of WINREC fit well, though I don't know how to configure them.

    A default option permits to autoset the matrix at LOD file loading, for
    a sound restitution/processing coming from the microphone.


@{0U}Survey the sound entry@{0}

    A function is dedicaced for the survey of the microphone entry. If this
    is hacked ("bidouill‚e"), this can alert for dummy. So this option
    is deselected by default.

    If you choose to look upon CODEC stress, the alerts will appear but
    once. The option will be automaticaly deselected after the alert to avoid
    repetition. Reselect it when your problem is solved.

    You can choose for the saturation survey the automatic decrease of
    the gain instead of the alert.


@{0U}Falcon specificity@{0}

    Iphig‚nie was written with XBIOS/GEM standard respect. But some
    functions lacks:

    ú matrix monitoring
    ú internal speaker monitoring and managment
    ú DSP reset

    Bad PEEK and SPOKE are thus done.
    So Iphig‚nie is specific for Falcon, but can easily work with small
    modifications with a Falcon compatible machine (please, send me the
    caracteristics or, better, the developper docs).

   This program is Freeware. No fee is asked for its use.

   Copy is legal and strongly advised.

   But: I deny my reponsability for the use. You're the one and only
   responsible with wrong files manipulations or damages on the Sound
   System (bad LOD file, DSP overclocking).
   Iphig‚nie works very well with my Falcon, this is the only insurance
   I can give you.

   If this program pleases you, I invite you to send me a e- or snail-
   mail. It'll contain sweet or bad words, bugs reporting, requests for
   new functions...

    Iphig‚nie is Falcon specific. You can try to run it under another
    Atari machine, but you'll have no available function.

    Iphig‚nie can be launched as GEM application (*.APP or *.PRG) or as
    accessory (*.ACC). Just rename the program with the extension you
    want.

    0) Delete your old *.IPH files: you can keep them but the matrix details
       will have to be reset.

    1) Put IPHIGNEY.APP everywhere on your hard-disk (or the ACC folder
       if you have changed the extension for accessory). The ressource
       file IPHIGENY.RSC @{0B}must@{0} be beside the program.

    2) Delete the old IPHIGENY.INF and the olds *.IPH files. These has
       changed and can be upgraded in the future without a new delete.

    3) Launch Iphig‚nie. Set the folders for IPH, LOD and documentation,
       set also the options and save them.

    4) Iphig‚nie supports VA_START and Drag&Drop protocols. Declare this
       in your desktop as accepting IPH and LOD files.

    Due to a bug I couldn't fix in the accessory mode, Iphig‚nie can't
    accepts parameters at launch.

@{0U}Known bugs and limitations                                              @{0}

    ú @{0B}Caution@{0}: don't monitor the Sound Sytem for a long time.
      There's no recommendation of Atari Corp nor advise in the
      developper docs concerning repeated matrix and PSG register
      reading.

      So monitoring must be short (2 or 3 minutes). Close the main
      window or iconify it to stop monitoring.

    ú Sometimes, DSP cannot execute a LOD file: you should reset the DSP
      before a new try.

    ú Sometimes at cold boot, espacially under MagiC: the first call to the
      DSP freeze the Falcon and it must be reset. The use of DSPSLOW1.PRG
      in your AUTO folder may avoid this.

    ú Devconnect function (matrix configuration main function) is directly
      used by Iphig‚nie, without patch. If you have problems to configure
      your external clock to the matrix, you should use FDI_INIT.PRG
      (or equivalent) in your AUTO folder.
