  16 colors 640*400 pixels screen is the minimum required.

  A modern operating system such as MagiC or MiNT is strongly advised,
  with an optimized VDI like NVDI.

  Requires the "EdDI" cookie to display on graphic cards.
  Falcon and new machines such as Milan have this by nature.
  If you have a graphic card with an old operating system, you'll need NVDI.
 
  The program uses plenty of memory, moreover on high-colored screens.
  So if you have not enough space or if the game becomes slower, run
  it in 640*480 16 colors.
  
  Location is important to access graphics and datas, the folder keeping
  XEDITOR.PRG, XEDITOR.HYP, XEDITOR.RSC must be besides XENON2.DAT, such as:
  
  XENON2.PRG
  XENON2.DAT\*
  XENON2.DAT\IMAGES\*
  XENON2.DAT\COLORS\*
  XENON2.DAT\DATAS\*
  XENON2.UTL\XEDITOR.PRG
  XENON2.UTL\XEDITOR.RSC
  XENON2.UTL\XEDITOR.HYP

  ST-Guide installation is required if you want to call the
  documentation directly from the program. Make it as *.ACC or
  declare its path in the environment variable STGUIDE$.
  ie in MAGX.INF, #_ENV STGUIDE=C:\ST-GUIDE.ACX

  - Select edited level with the menu entry.
  
  - Map window and sprites set window, populated with map datas,
    accordingly to the selected level.
    
  - Select one item in the sprite set, then draw it to the map.
    The map is 16*16 squared.
    
    Mobile creatures are not sprited-drawn, but displayed with a line and text.
    A line represent the moment when the scrolling will trigger their display.
    For grouped creatures (3 or more), select and put just one.
  
  - If you want to delete something on the map, 2 methods:
    1) unselect the item in the sprites set, 
       and left-click on the choosen zone on the map.
    or
    2) keep your choice in the sprites set,
       and right-click on the choosen zone on the map.
    
  - If the item is greater than 16*16 pixels, click on the upper-left corner
    of the sprite or text.
