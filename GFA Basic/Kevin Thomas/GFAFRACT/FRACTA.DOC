FRACTALS IN GFA BASIC

Written by Kevin Thomas

     So, another fractal program. This one is my first program written in
GFA Basic. After previous attempts  in  Pascal,  this one was much easier
(nothing against Pascal, I just have a Basic sort of brain). This program
has the features  I  wanted  in  a  Fractal  program  -  Manual parameter
setting, Zoom, Julia and Mandelbrot curves, Autosave, etc.

Basic Menu Functions:
          Julia - Chooses a Julia curve fractal
          Mandel - Chooses a Mandelbrot curve fractal
          Zoom - Zooms in a specific area. This function allows a
                 variable zoom of any section of the drawing. It is
                 only available after a fractal has been drawn or
                 loaded. Center the crosshairs on the desired area.
          Draw - Draws the fractal to the desired parameters
          Parms - Manual entry of fractal parameters
          Defaults - Resets parameters to defaults
          Load - Loads a fractal drawing and associated parameters
          Save - Save a fractal drawing and associated parameters
          Help - A little bit of help
          Delete - deletes a file
          Rename - Renames a fractal drawing and associated
                   parameter file
          Autosave - Saves fractal after drawing

     A few words about  the  files  produced.  When  a fractal drawing is
saved, two files are saved. The first is the actual screen, the second is
the parameters used to produce the  screen.  The  files are named for the
type of fractal,i.e. Mandel  or  Julia,  with  an extender indicating the
resolution, or if it is a data  file.  For example, a file might be named
MANDEL01.FR0, the 0 on  the  end  indicating  low resolution. There would
also be an associated MANDEL01.DAT for the data file.
     The basic information used for developing this program came from the
book 'The Beauty of Fractals', by  H.-O.  Peitgen and P. H. Richter. This
book is published by Springer-Verlag, ISBN 0-387- 15851-0, and well worth
getting just for the lovely pictures.  Also  of help was the classic 'The
Fractal Nature  of  Geometry'  by  Benoit  B.  Mandelbrot.  This  book is
published by W. H. Freeman  and  Company,  ISBN 0-7167-1186-9. Both books
are highly recommended.
