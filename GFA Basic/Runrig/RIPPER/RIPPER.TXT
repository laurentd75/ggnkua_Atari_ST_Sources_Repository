                      the RUNRIG RIPPER v1.0

     This is a useful utility if you're on the lookout for fonts 
or GFX and you lack the artist's eye. You can hack fonts and 
pictures from menus/games/demos. Simply load the depacked files 
into the ripper and search through the memory until you locate a 
piece of graphics which you can then save.
     The keyboard is set out logically:

numeric keypad: 
up:       (           )            /            *               
        page      20 lines      5 lines      1 line                                     
down:     7           8            9            -                        
  
Scroll memory:                  Alter plane configuration:
left:'4'  Right:'5'             left:6     right:+

other keys:
S - Save as degas pi1 format picture files(32034 bytes)
P - Grab palette for current screen
L - Load new file

     If you are still unsure as to how this program works, press 
'H' after loading to access the help screen.

     Have a ripping good time!
