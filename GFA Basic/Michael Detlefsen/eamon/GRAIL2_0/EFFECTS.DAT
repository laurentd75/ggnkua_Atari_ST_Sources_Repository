35
You see a strange procession of monks approaching.  They are singing a chant in Latin and periodically they hit their heads with large boards.  They file past you and out of sight.
You hear a loud crash and several bespectacled men with handkerchiefs on their heads appear.  They wear their pants rolled up above their knees and they are shouting, 'Hello!' 'Shut up, Mr. Gumby!' and 'Sorry!' all at once.
They are all running into the walls.  Just as suddenly, they all fall into a large, deep crevasse!  The last you hear of them is a faint cry----- 'My braine hurts...'
You see a movie technician holding a black clapboard that reads 'Scene 24.'  He claps the board and says, 'Action!'  You then see a grotesque old man sitting by a fire.  He cackles wildly and says in a breathy voice,'You
would find the grail?  Seek the enchanter beyond the frozen waste-- he knows of a cave-- very much danger!  For beyond the cave is your goal!  Seek you ... the Bridge of Death!'  And as he cackles, the old man and the entire scene vanish!
A secret panel in the wall bursts open and several robe-clad monks leap out!  'Noooo one expects the Spanish Inquisition!' screams the leader.  'Our weapon is surprise! That's all--just surprise!'   'Uh, what about fear?' asks a priest.
'Oh, yes, alright, surprise and fear,' the leader replies.  The same priest asks,'And a fanatical devotion to the...'  'Shut up!' howls the leader. 'Now see what you've done?!?  The whole effect's ruined!!  Just forget the whole thing!'
And with that the priests file back through the secret door and it seals without a trace.
Presently a head pokes over a wall and says in a thick French accent, 'Sooo... another English pig-dog type chasing after the grail!  Scoop pumpkins, you empty-headed animal food trough wiper!
Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries!  Go away, you silly English knnigget with the brain of a duck, you know!'  The head then vanishes back behind the wall of the castle.
'Bravely bold Sir Robin                 
 brought forth from Camelot.            
 He was not afraid to die,              
 no brave Sir Robin!                    
 He was not at all afraid to be killed  
 in nasty ways!
 Brave,brave,brave,brave Sir Robin!     
 He was not in the least bit scared     
 to be mashed into a pulp.              
 Nor to have his eyes gouged out,       
 and his elbows broken.                 
 To have his kneecaps split          
 and his body burned away               
 and his limbs all hacked and mangled,  
 brave Sir Robin!                       
 His head smashed in                    
 and his heart cut out                  
 and his liver removed....                
  'Uh, I think that's enough singing for now,' says a rather pale and sweaty Sir Robin, who is clutching his chest.
As you enter the room, Dad bellows out, 'Who are you???'
'I'm your son,' says Herbert.  'Not you,' Dad yells, smacking him.
Herbert looks at you and says,'Someone got my note and is here to rescue me!'
Tim gestures dramatically and says, 'You would find the Grail? To the north lies a cave, wherein runes written upon the very rock make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail!'  He adds savagely, 'But if you
do doubt your courage or your strength you'd best turn back!!  For death awaits you with nasty big pointy teeth!!!'   
'You see,' Dennis says, 'supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses.  We are an anarcho-syndaclist collective, holding bi-weekly meetings at which we....' and Dennis drones on and on and on.......
