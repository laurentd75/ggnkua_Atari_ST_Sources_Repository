having better things to do than wiping the noses of greenhorns. 
young green-horns always need someone to lead them by the hand. 
the things he has to go through for some stupid upstarts.       
he should have listened to his mother and been a brain surgeon. 
good fer nothin' young adventurers should be taken out an hung. 
strange saxon names ye can never pronounce let alone spell..    
he should have listened to his mother and gone into taxidermy.  
having to computerize this damn book business sometime..        
having seen ugly faces before but never anything like this ..   
know-it-all attitudes of the new adventurers will do them in.   
if he gets the chance he's going to get outta this rat race.    
someday leaving this place an' runnin off with the bar wench.   
everybody always bein' in a hurry and never have anything to do.
young adventurers never usin' their rightful name anyways ...   
lookin' up stupid names all day and all night is fer lesser men.
he should have listened to his mother and gone into optometry.  
he should have listened to his mother and shot himself.         
wishing a dragon would fly over and burn this joint.            
these damn Flair pens..                                         
the idiot on the other shift with the lousy handwriting.        
bad light and bad beer and no football on tv...                 
people comin' in when he just got to the red level in Shamus....
