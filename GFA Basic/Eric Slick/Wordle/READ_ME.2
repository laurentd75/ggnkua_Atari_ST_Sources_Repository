I know of only one bug.  When you finish playing a game and chose
View Words, the slider box doesn't work properly.  To correct
this, just close the window and reopen it.  The Alert Box just
before closing the window fixes the problem.  Why?  I haven't the
foggiest idea.  It's an odd bug that was introduced during
compiling and after hours of frustrated debugging, I was unable to
weed it out.
