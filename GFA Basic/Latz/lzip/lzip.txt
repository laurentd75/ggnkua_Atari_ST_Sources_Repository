*** lzip *** Version 1.0

A simple tool for zipping files or folders under TOS or FreeMiNT,
by using MiNT zip executable.

68k version: lzip.prg
Coldfire/FireBee version: lzip.app


Installation:

Copy the program folder to a TOS partition and place lzip.prg (.app) as
a desktop icon for easy drag and drop.


Usage:

- Doubleclick on lzip.prg (.app) and select a file or folder to compress
  in the fileselector. You can also drag and drop a file or folder on the
  program icon.
- Then you can choose if the file/folder is zipped with the same name
  (+ .zip extension) and location, or if you want to use another name/location
  for the zip archive. You don't need to enter the extension ".zip" for the
  archive name, it will be added automatically.
- If a zip archive with this name is already present (or if you select a zip
  archive as output file), the new file/folder will be added (or updated if
  present in the archive before).


Notes:

- Zipping multiple files/folders at once or space characters in names
  are not supported yet.
- Already compressed archives can not be zipped again.
- The zip executable don't accept spaces or additional dots for the
  ARCHIVE NAME. So if you zip a file/folder with multiple dots in its name,
  these will be transformed to underscores " _ " for the archive name, e.g.
  input file "a.name.with.dots.txt" will generate the archive name
  "a_name_with_dots.zip" (file in archive keeps its original name of course).
  If you enter an archive filename with dots or spaces in output fileselector,
  these will also be transformed to undersores.
- If you like to see a verbose output on console (if something don't work),
  please start the program with "-v" as first parameter, e.g in TeraDesk/
  Set Applications dialog/Command should be set to "-v%f".

This is the first useful program i wrote, so don't expect too much ;-)
If you like to translate lzip to other languages please send me a
translated "lzip_xx.txt" (use lzip_en.txt in folder "lang" as a
template) and i will enable your language in the program.
Tested on Falcon/CT60 and FireBee with TOS and FreeMiNT/XaAES.
Use at your own risk!
