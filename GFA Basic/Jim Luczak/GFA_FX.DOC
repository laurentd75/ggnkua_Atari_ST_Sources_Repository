       G.F.A. Basic F/X is a interactive program taht demonstrates some of the

       capabilities of G.F.A. Basic.



       There are three support programs that G.F.A. Basic F/X uses.



       GFA_FX_1.PRG, GFA_FX_2.PRG, and GFA_FX_M.PRG.



       These programs are used to demonstrate G.F.A. Basic's EXEC Command.

       GFA_FX_1.PRG and GFA_FX_2.PRG are used in Medium Resolution.

       GFA_FX_1.PRG and GFA_FX_M.PRG are used in High Resolution.



       Try running one of the Support programs. As you will notice, they are

       completely independent programs. G.F.A. Basic Gives you the ability to

       access programs directly from Basic.



       Another feature of G.F.A. Basic are the many commands to direct I/O to

       the disk drives.

       G.F.A. Basic F/X will search up to 16 disk drives for the support

       programs mentioned above. Try moving one of the support programs to

       another disk drive. The program will find and load it. ( The support

       programs must be in the Root Directory of the drive, Not in a Folder.

       ).















       Try programming with G.F.A. Basic. Everything a Computer Language

       should be.
