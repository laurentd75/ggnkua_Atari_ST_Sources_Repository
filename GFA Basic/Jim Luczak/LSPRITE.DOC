       Low Resolution Sprite and Mouse Editor Program

This program was adapted from a monochrome sprite editor program 
written by Arnfried Griesert of West Germany.  The program was 
translated into English, converted to run in low resolution mode, 
and enhanced with the addition of image type selection, color 
selection, and real time viewing of the completed sprite or mouse 
image.

The program uses the currently active  color palette.  If you are 
working with special colors make sure to set them up before 
running the program.  

Foreground and background (mask) color selection is available at 
any time while using the program.  I will use the term 'mask' to 
indicate the sprite or mouse background.  This will avoid 
confusion with the final viewing background color selection 
available using the F7 key.  The left mouse button selects 
the foreground color while the right mouse button selects the mask 
color.  Just point the mouse and click.  You can change the colors 
at any time you are running the program.  If you need a white 
mask, you can draw the image using a dark mask color selection and 
then change the color to white for final viewing.

Available functions are:

F1   Loads a sprite or mouse image previously saved with the F2 
     funtion.  This function looks for *.SHP files.

F2   Saves a sprite or mouse image for later retrieval using F1.  
     You should save files with *.SHP extenders, as this is what 
     F1 will look for.

F3   Creates a GFA BASIC program segment which will generate the 
     sprite image.  This program segment will have an extender of 
     *.LST.  This program segment can be merged and used with your 
     own program.

F4   Create a GFA BASIC program segment which will generate the 
     mouse image.  This program segment will have an extender of 
     *.LST.  This program segment can be merged and used with your 
     own program. 

F5   Erases the sprite or mouse image being worked on.

F6   Selects whether a sprite or mouse image is being worked on.  
     This selection is only necessary when viewing using F8.  A 
     sprite image has the mask (background) and foreground bit-
     patterns stored alternately while a mouse image has the mask 
     bit-patterns stored consecutively followed by the foreground 
     bit-patterns.

F7   Allows you to change the background color of the sprite final 
     viewing area.  After pressing F7, click on "Continue" and 
     then select the color you wish by clicking on the color 
     rectangle of your choice.

F8   Allows you to view the final sprite or mouse image.  The 
     sprite image will be shown in the special color window on the 
     right side of the screen.  The mouse image will replace the 
     normal ST mouse.  By clicking one of the buttons, the 
     original mouse will be restored.

F9   Not used.

F10  Exits the program.

     The arrow keys select the pixel for the sprite or mouse hot 
     spot.
