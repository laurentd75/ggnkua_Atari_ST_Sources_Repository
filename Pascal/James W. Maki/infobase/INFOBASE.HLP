If the structure of the database does not    9match the current screen design, the data must be filter-9ed (See Filter help).  If a file to be saved and a file  9on disk have the same name, the disk file is renamed with9a .BSC or .BDT extender to avoid losing data.  Be very   9careful when saving a search database not to overwrite!  9Filter***************************************************9                  FILTER A DATABASE                      9                                                         9     One of the most convenient, and yet most difficult  9abilities of InfoBaseST, is to load a database into a new9screen design.  This can be used to redesign an existing 9database, view only part of a database or simply to view 9the data in a different format.  The information line is 9very important to this task.  Watch it closely.  It is   9also a good idea to have the screen design of the data-  9written down for reference.                              9     Load or design the target screen design.  Then load 9the database.  You must now instruct InfoBaseST how to   9"filter" the disk based data into the current screen     9design.  The information line will describe the current  9data field of the database.  The cursor will determine   9where the data will be placed on the screen.  Move the   9cursor with the mouse.  When the cursor is in the correct9field, press the RIGHT mouse button.  The next data field9will be displayed.  Use the ^arrow keys to change the    9field.  Select Quit (^Q) from the File menu when done.   9Report @ Commands****************************************9                   REPORT @ COMMANDS                     9                                                         9     When designing a report, the output can be created  9in several ways.  Typing on the screen will produce the  9same output for each record.  Selecting a data field will9display the data for each record into the report.  There 9are also several special commands to output variable     9information to the report.                               9                                                         9     @Date - Print the current date.                     9     @Page - Print the page number on each page of the   9             report.                                     9     @Line - Print the line number for each record.      9     @Rec# - Print the record number for each record.    9     @Null - Eliminate formating for the remainder of    9             the report line.  There will be no white    9             space added between fields to pad to the    9             field width.  Useful for address labels,    9             for instance.                               9                                                         9Delete/New Records***************************************9                  DELETE/CREATE RECORD                   9                                                         9                                                         9                                                         9                                                         9     A new record is created by pressing the TAB key or  9selecting New Rec from the Record menu.  This will add   9a new blank record to the database.  A database cannot   9be saved until it contains at least two records.         9                                                         9     The current record is deleted by selected Delete    9the Record menu or pressing ^D.  This will remove the    9record from the database.  If this is done by mistake,   9press UNDO.  This will recover an accidentally deleted   9record.                                                  9                                                         9                                                         9                                                         9                                                         9                                                         9DESIGN MODE**********************************************9                     DESIGN MODE                         9                                                         9Options : Design a database        Design/Enter - ^E     9          Retrieve a design        File/Open    - ^O     9          Quit InfoBaseST          File/Quit    - ^Q     9                                                         9     Use Design Mode to create templates for a database. 9Select the location for a data field by moving the cursor9with the arrow keys or with the mouse.
