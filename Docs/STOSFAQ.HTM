 Q.: What is STOS BASIC
<hr>

Written by Francois Lionet and  Constantin Sotiropoulos  Published by 
Mandarin/Europress Software, Although no longer supported by either,<P>

STOS is the forerunner to the Amiga version, AMOS, AMOS Pro etc.. and 
more recently Klick and Play on the PC,<P> 
Mark Montreuil came up with this defenition ......<P>
  STOS (for ST Operating System) is a programming  language  based on  
BASIC ( Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code ),that makes 
creating sound,graphics and movement on the Atari 16/32 bit line of 
computers as painless as possible. STOS has commands that handle input
/output, animation, music logic and program execution in an easy to 
understand way.A STOS programmer can spend more time on actual game 
design than on the fiddly bits.<P>
Many things that were not considered possible,such as changing screen
resolutions in the middle of a program or  writing Arcade-type  games 
in a  BASIC language, are a reality with  STOS.  Hundreds of  quality 
games, demos,utilities  and  educational  packages have already  been 
written in STOS.<P>
  STOS is a full-featured software development tool.  Using STOS, art 
screens created in specialised paint packages,like Degas,Neo or Crack 
Art, can be easily used to create basic game graphics.STOS has built-
in Sprite, Music,Map, Font and Sound effects generators.You can write 
some code,and,at a keypress,call up any of the added utilities(called 
accessories)  to work on added features.  You can even write your own 
accessories, to use at any time. Machine-code  routines can be called 
from within STOS, and new commands (called extensions),can be written 
to enhance STOS's functionality.Some extensions that are currently 
available include 3D, the Missing Link and Misty 
(see <a href="#ext">Extensions list</a> for further information).<p>
  All in all, STOS  is the perfect tool to  bring your  game ideas to 
reality without having to trudge through realms of machine code!<p>

  Thanks for that Mark,but it must be added that with the advent of 
such  extensions as  Extra by  Martin  Cubitt plus  some of  the more 
obscure  commands that can be  found in other  extensions STOS can no 
longer be tagged as just a Game Creator, serious  programs are  now 
beginning to appear, APPLications are now a reality with a little bit 
of assembler added,  there is now  very little or  nothing that  STOS 
cannot achieve,<p>
<a name=where></a>
<hr>
(2) Q.:Where do I get hold of it<br>
<hr>
 The simple truth is that STOS BASIC and the Compiler are both Commercial products 
and can not be freely copied, The rights to sell STOS are owned by Europress, I personaly contacted them who replied that<p>
<prE>No one here would be able to find the time 
    or Interest in anything regarding STOS BASIC
</PRE>
The actual Copyright owners are the three Authors of STOS BASIC, Constantin Sotiropoulos,
Francois Lionet and I beleive Jawx, Without there permission STOS can not be freely copied, Look for advertisements in Internet newsgroups, ask for it yourself or try to get the coverdisk version.


<a name=like></a>
<hr>
Q.: What is it like to program<br>
<hr>
   Easy is what most people will tell you,but that is relative, there 
are aspects of STOS that make programming far easier than that of  
another language,for instance LOCATE 10,10 : PRINT STOS will print 
the  word STOS  at collumn 10 line 10 on your screen, I would hate to 
think how  many lines of code this would take in C or assembler, yet 
the outcome is exactly the same,<br> 
   But STOS is NOT as simple as all that if you are going to try and 
make a fully fledged platformer of a high quality, easy if you want a  
slow flip screen jerky and unresponsive game, but quality will take a 
lot of time and effort and programming skills not readily available 
from your manual, <p>
   
   Billy Allen of Top Notch software, Author of the Misty and Missing 
Link extensions can be quoted as saying,<p>
    
  The next time you see a badly written STOS game,don't say  STOS is 
   awful, say this programmer is awful.<p>

   STOS uses line numbers,in my opinion there is nothing wrong with 
this, but it is the old way of programming people tend to frown on 
this system,but at the end of the day its the easiest to get to grips 
with and it does the job, and thats what counts,<p>
<a name=extras></a>
<hr>
 Q.: What extras are available to compliment it ?
<hr>
    There are  many extras, most can be regarded as  upgrades,some as 
programming aids and some that are there to do jobs that STOS  cannot 
handle alone, <br>
  Most of these files can now be found at the <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/phansoft/file.htm">STOS FILE</A> Site., 
packed with Extensions,Source and all manner of helpfull STOS files,<br>


 EXTENSIONS: These are extra commands for STOS,once you place the file 
into your STOS folder the commands are there  ready for use, this is 
exactly how Mandarin would have upgraded STOS if they where still 
supporting it,but these extensions are made by enthusiasts and as such have a better understanding of what the STOS programmer needs,there is a list of <a href="#ext">available extensions</a> in this file, there is something for everyone in there,<p> 

  <a href="#acb">ACB</a>, Accessories that are loaded along with STOS and stay in memory  
ready for your use,these are normally programming aids as opposed to  
something that is used in your program, for example there is a picture compactor, 
an art package and many many more.<p>

  M/C ,  These are machine code programs,simply load into a bank and  
using the various AREG DREG etc you pass variables to the programs and  
run them using CALL,usually quite small and usually used for speed,  
but also for convenience, for example there is an M/C program  for  
displaying spectrum pictures with 512 colours on an STFM, A <a href="#mc">m/c list</a> can be 
found in this document,<p>



 


<a name=level></a>
<hr>
Q.: What level of programming can be achieved <br>
<hr>

  Can commercial quality games be made?, Yes is the resounding answer, H.E.R.O.  
(now freeware) was released 
around the end of 1994 as commercial,ST Format gave an early release demo of it away on a cover 
disk, then they did a 2 page review and gave it 85%, then after discovering
the program was written in STOS BASIC,the following issue of ST Format 
issue 65 December 94 had this gem in the News section,<p> 
 
   <b>  <i>IDS have also revealed that HERO was completely written and 
      compiled  in STOS,The announcement has blown rather a large 
      hole in the myth that STOS is too basic and slow to be used 
      in any serious form to write games.</i></b><p>

  There are many other examples of STOS in the commercial world, not 
least the FUN SCHOOL series that was not only written in STOS but not  
even compiled, these packages ( of which there were many ) are still 
regarded as the top educational software for the ST,<p>

  A Shareware educational program called MAGIC STORY BOOK was featured on the Rolf Harris childrens tv show, some years ago admittedly, but 
the program was deemed to be so good that ST Format have recently re-
released it on their March 1995 coverdisk, you may be interested to 
note that a total of six STOS written programs where given away that 
month via magazine cover disk,<p>

   Every public domain catalouge you pick up will contain a very high 
amount of STOS coded programs, from public domain to licenceware, <p>

 
<a name=read></a>
<hr>
 Q.: What HELP or reading matter is available<br>
<hr>


 The game makers manual by Stephen Hill was a good production but out  
of print now,there is also the beginners guide to STOS,available from 
public domain libraries complete with source disks,unfortunately 
these either deal with pure STOS (without extensions) or are too old 
to include them, However the game makers manual is most usefull as the only publication that deals with extension writing and was almost definitly used as a reference guide for the Misty, Missing link, Extra and many other well known extensions,<p>

  There have been STOS diskmagazines in the past,Most can be downloaded from the <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/phansoft/file.htm">STOS FILE</A> Site.<p>
<ul>
<li>STOSSER Diskzine<br>
For over three years this was undisputedly the Top ATARI STOS Diskmagazine, the first year and a half saw a new Issue every month, 29 Issues in total with the last issue appearing April 1997,Timeless in there content, todays STOS coders can use back issues for Articles, tutorials Tips and Tricks, Source code a plenty means these should be in every STOS programmers collection,<p>
<li>STESTOSTERONE<br>
In 1996 4 Issues of this diskzine where produced, all aimed at the STe owning STOS Community, with STe tutorials including much needed advice on the Famous Asa burrows extension, all the best STe extension are on disk and this is a must if interested in STOS and getting the best out of your STe,<p>
<li>MUCH STOS GIGAZINE<BR>
Brilliant one off Issue from Black Eagle, This is one of my favroutes, has some nw and interesting ideas in there, definatly worth a download<p>
<li>HP SOURCE<BR>
This is a programmers diskzine, a pioneer in its field, heavy STOS content, I am unsure as to how many copies where made, Only Issue 2 is on the STOS File site<p>

</ul>

 In back issues of ST Format you will find the STOS answers section that 
had been going for years,but since stopped, alledgedly due to lack of interest,
people such as Asa Burrows and Billy Allen have held the post of problem solver for this section
, the latest and last person to hold the post was 
Frank Charlton, Unfortunatly Frank will have the pleasure of being the last of this breed due to the sad demse of ST Format magazine,<p>
   
  There is a STOS mailing list if you are on line, a simple e-mail 
will add your address to the list, the advantages are the ability to 
swap and compare notes with STOS users from all over the world within 
an instance, at present the mailing list is probably the fastest way 
to solve your STOS problems and answer any STOS queries, see <a href=#address>address 
section</a> in this FAQ,<p>
                          
 
<a name=mis></a>
<hr>
What else ?<br><hr>
 <center>***  Miscellaneous   ***</center><br>         
  STOS ADVENTURE CREATOR and the more recent STOS GRAPHIC ADVENTURE  
CREATOR are two programs from Deano of Silly Software that coupled 
with STOS basic will allow you to easily make adventure games to do 
with as you please, see your local pdl for details,<p>

  There have also been shoot'em up construction kits and all manners 
of add on packages that need STOS basic and are designed to help you  
easily make programs, however you are advised to make the programs 
yourself,<p>
   
  You can actually change the STOS commands by editing files within  
the STOS folder,a full tutorial and editor routine appeared in the 
one off STOS GIGAZINE by Black Eagle,<p>

<a name=history></a><hr>
<center> 
 *** STOS Release history by Andrei Ellman ***</center>
<center> 
 *** Updated by Constantin Sotiropoulos***</center>
<ul>
<li>STOS 1 was only released in France in early 1988 by Cedic Nathan.<br>
<li>STOS 2.3 Was released in the UK By Mandarin in November/October 1988<br>
<li>STOS 2.4 Is a patch to remove some bugs in STOS 2.3 and make it work 
with the compiler &#40;1989&#41;<br>
<li>STOS 2.5 Is a patch to make STOS run on the STE &#40;1989&#41;<br>
<li>STOS 2.6 is a patch to make STOS run on STEs with TOS 1.62 (1990)<p>
<li>STOS 2.7 &#40;beta2&#41; is a patch to make STOS a little cleaner, and support more TOS versions. &#40;unofficial, source provided&#41;.

</ul>
If your version of STOS is below 2.6,You must update it immediately,
especially the compiler.You will then be able to make  programs that 
run on TOS 1.62 <br>
STOS 2.7 From the STOS File Site would also be highly reccomended, Compiler 2.7 Makes programs that use the 
STOS tracker extension compile. <p>






<a name="emu">STOS under Emulation</a><p>
Yes STOS can run on a PC under emulation, Various have been tried with different results, By far the best results can be achieved using PaCifiST from 
<A href="http://www.pacifist.fatal-design.com/">http://www.pacifist.fatal-design.com/</a>,This emulator is freeware, small and easy to set up, STOS BASIC, runs directly from your PC Hard Drive, However the Compiler shows best results from
a PaCifiST disk image, This is easy to set up once you have installed the emulator.<p>

Gemulator now runs STOS with just as pleasing results and will run in a window or full screen 
under directX, Gemulator is commercial and can be found at <a href="http://www.emulators.com">http://www.emulators.com</a>
, However if you don't mind not having sound then you can get a demo version from the same site that runs STOS just as well.<P>

To run STOS BASIC in all its glory with the latest extensions then you will need the latest STOS, By this I mean the actual PRG that
runs your STOS, these can be found from the home page of the programmer responsible for 
keeping STOS up to date, Anthony Jacques is the man and his files are at <A href="http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/jacquesa/">
http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/jacquesa/</a><p>
<br>
<pRE>


</PRE>
<a name="gem">STOS and GEM</a><p>
The simple answer is NO you can not use STOS and GEM together, some brave attempts have been made to mix the two, perhaps the best
but allways doomed to failure attempt was by Paul Jones , His efforts can be found through the STOS file site.<P>

Indeed he did manage to access GEM from his Falcon and there are screen shots to prove it, 
However there is no fully working extension that will allow a STOS BASIC programmer to access 
GEM and produce a compiled and fully working program that calls and uses GEM.<P>

STOS and its authors,<br>
Information From Martin Cubitt<br>
Additions from Constantin Sotiropoulos<br>
<p>
 

 Heres  a few interesting facts about the men behind STOS BASIC, <p>
<ol>
 <li>Constantin Sotiropoulos is the originator of STOS BASIC and was joined
in the programming of the language by Francois Lionet some 2 months into the project<br>

<LI>The name of Stos was proposed  by Frederic Pinlet who was one of the
members of JAWX's team.<BR>

<LI>The Jawx team was composed by Frederic Pinlet, Jacques Fleurance,
Francois Lionet and Constantin Sotiropoulos.<BR>

<LI>The name of STOS is comming from ST Operating System.<BR>

<LI>The first version of STOS included a complete DOS-like operating system,
a Forth,a 68000 Assembler and BPL a Batch programming language.<BR>
The idea was to eventualy create 2 more Languages for AMIGA and PC.
AMOS for AMIGA Operating System and PCOS for PC Operating System.<br>

<li>After the STOS has been released by Mandarin Software (EuroPress),Constantin Sotiropoulos
started a new job on an UNIX system, concerning Software protections.<br>

<li>Constantin Sotiropoulos currently has his own company (Rolling Press) ont he IBM PC platforms<Br>


<li>Constantin Sotiropoulos stopped programming on the ATARI around 1989-90<br>

<li> Francois is a qualified veterinary surgeon.<br>

<li>He married Carine.<br>

<li> His first computer was a Superboard II from Ohio Scientific, 
in 1981.<br>

<li> He wrote two games for Firebird software: Chicken Chase (Oric, 
CPC & C64) and Ole (CPC). He also wrote three commercial Oric games 
and a musical puzzle for the C64.<br>

<li> He wrote the Captain Blood conversions for the CPC and C64, 
in about one month.<br>
<li> Francois can program almost any computer.<br>
<li> He converted Around the World in 80 Days to the Atari ST using 
STOS. The French publisher, FIL, went bust on the day he completed it<br>

 <li> STOS took 18 months to write using Kuma's K-Seka.<br>
<li> The compiler took three months to write using DevPacII.Extension 
hand-ling was the most difficult part to program.<br>
<li> Francois programs listening to loud music through his headphones
. He built a flashing light to tell him when the phone rings<br>

<li> STOS was first released in France in the Spring of 1988. It was 
not an immediate success<br>

<li>Mandarin bought the rights to STOS and a few bits and bobs were 
changed.<br>

<li>Francois wrote the Orbit game in two days.Zoltar was more of a 
challenge,taking a whole week<br>

<li>The worst bug in STOS was the way in which it handled new 
extensions.<br>

<li>The hardest part was writing the sprite trap.<br>

<li> Francois, being French, has to  do military service (ha ha). He 
takes his computers with him.<br>

<li>Francois' heroes are Jes (Starglider) San,Bill(Sinbad)Williams, 
Jeff (everything with Llama's and Yaks) Minter and the Captain 
Blood team.<br>

<li> Skateball from Ubisoft was originally written in STOS and then 
converted to the CPC, Spectrum, C64, PC and Nintendo.<br>

<li> Bullet Train is on sale in France at around the 20 mark (two 
or three years ago) under the title Expressing with faster scrolling 
and improved graphics.<p>

<hr>
<p>
<a name="mail"><Font size=5>The STOS Mailing List</font></a>
</font><font size=3>
<p>
There is a very healthy STOS mailing list that boasts a large membership including many extension writers and well known STOS authors from around the world, There are people on the list who used to use STOS and know enough to offer advice and help as well as tips and tricks.<p>

The STOS Mailing list is currently the quickest way to solve any of your STOS related problems or queries, Simply post a message and within hours other STOS user from around the world will be answering, commenting and joining in whatever subject you have brought to the forum, NEW STOS users are especialy welcome as most people on the list take great pleasure in passing on whatever they have learnt over the years.<p>

As the STOS list also consists of a lot of Extension developers and even people who are actively upgrading STOS itself, then this is the place to find out everything first, even when something has been released you will find out here at least a month before the off line community has a chance of knowing,<p>

To Join the STOS Mailing list you simply email the current list keeper who at this time is Phil Hough and his email is <a href="mailto:houghp6@cs.man.ac.uk">houghp6@cs.man.ac.uk</a> Just ask him in any for you like...but be polite, to add you to the STOS mailing list,<p>

By joining the STOS mailing list you will not be overwhelmed with hundreds of emails a day, even at its busiest it probably only generates a dozen a day... mostly it can be that amount a week,But the advantages of being on the list are all set out above, any STOS user with Internet access should email  <a href="mailto:houghp6@cs.man.ac.uk">houghp6@cs.man.ac.uk</a> and get on this list immediatly<br>

<hr>
<ul>
<li>COMPACT...........Used in conjunction with the compact extension 
for packing pictures,<p>

<li>COMPACT2..........The original COMPACT but with added picture 
formats,<p>

<li>COMPILER..........Used in conjunction with the compiler extension 
for compiling your STOS basic files to make a PRG,<p>

<li>ERROR  BASE........To quickly check what error you have  just  
encountered, faster than looking it up in the manual as thats 
in alphabetical order  and not numeric, yet STOS gives you a number, 
strange?,<p>

<li>PAINT2............An excellent art package,  saves you having to 
exit  STOS to do some last minute changes, but its a rather large 
ACB<p>

<li>MOUSCOLO..........Will load a picture or grab from a bank and when 
you move the mouse over the picture it will give you the exact co-
ordinates and also the  colour of the pixel under the mouse hotspot,  
not only the colour  but the colour value as well,<p>

<li>DISPLAY...........Lets you load and read a doc file ( packed or 
unpacked  ) very handy for extension manuals,<p>

<li>LINK..............On line help for the missing link commands, <p>

<li>SPRITE............Fully functional sprite editor,  stood the test 
of  time, never been bettered and never will, <p>

<li>SPRITE 2..........For medium resolution sprites,<p>

<li>FONTY.............Load  view and install various fonts into STOS  
Basic  or the compiler,<p>

<li>WHATMBK...........All  those  lost mbk files you find on disk  
can  now  be recognised with this handy utility,<p>

<li>STOSDRAW..........Another capable art package that can be used 
from  within STOS Basic,<p>

<li>ASCII.............Shows  the available characters from within 
your  current font,<p>

</ul>
<HR>
 There are other ACB's and there are other versions of these,  
for  example there are many DISPLAYER ACB's,  these I would say 
are the most useful, it really depends on what you are working 
on at the time,  if you have  enough memory  then you should 
have most of the above loaded,  half meg users  are better not 
loading any,  just ACCLOAD each one as you need it, because they 
stay in memory its not a good idea with a 520,<p>

<a name=sam>SAMPLED SOUND</A><p>
Principially, there exist only 3 formats of Samples, Signed, Unsigned and IFF.
No matter what they are called ( AVR, WAV, SPL, SAM ) they usually fit into
one of these categories ...<p>
The Unsigned and the IFF-format is just a binary file consisting of all the
values of the sample. Unsigned is an originate copy, IFF is more or less an
inverse copy of it. If you own the ProTracker or something similar, it's
easy to find out what format the samples are ...<p>
The Signed format has a file-header and also -probably- some data stored
within the sample, for example finishing marks etc ...<p>
It would be a little too far out to describe all possible signed-formats,
for example AVR has also a file header where an extended name of the sample
can be stored etc, so i will just describe how to play what sample in STOS.
<>p><br>
STOS Maestro<br>
------------<br><br>
The original sample-replay-routines for STOS from Francis Lionet himself
plays samples from 5 to 22 KHz called SAM, the sample utility itself
can even work with up to 32 KHz, of course only mono since only the ST 
soundchip is used.<br><br>
STOS Maestro has originally been sold with the sampler-hardware but could also
be obtained without. The basic extension offers simple commands to replay
samples as RAW-data, that means unsigned binary, but also extended commands,
that could replay samples back and forth ( and the other way round ), 
repeating all over, slower, faster etc.<br><br>
Another possibility is to create a memory bank (mbk) in a special signed
format, that enabled STOS to play a specific sample out of this bank
without knowing what specific memory-address it is stored at, for example
samplay 7 played the 7th sample in the bank, where samples could differ
in speed and length.<br><br>
Playing Samples with 5 KHz sounded lousy, but needed very little CPU-time.
22KHz sounded pretty good, took up huge amounts of memory and slowed down
the system enourmosly.<br><br>
A typical sign of the STOS Maestro being used is that the sample slowed
down when the mouse is moved ...<br><br>

STE-Extension(s)<br>
----------------<br><br>
The original STE extension and some others, STE-related extensions, offered
DMA replay, costing absolutely no CPU time.<br><br>
The samples have to be in RAW, that means unsigned, format because all the
DMA sound does is simply take the values and play them without the possibilty
to work with marks or other format-commands.<br><br>
Replay can be done from 6 over 12 and 25 up to 50 KHz in Mono as well as
Stereo. The sample can be played once or continuosly.<br><br>
Since the DMA-sound doesn't need any CPU-time the system is not blocked in
any way, which means, keyboard, mouse, joystick and also Floppy- and Harddisk
stay completely available.<br><br>

Falcon-Extension<br>
----------------<br><br>
Similarly to the STE, the Falcon also offers DMA-stereo-sound. The Falcon
can play 16bit Stereo-samples in RAW format up to 50KHz in various speeds
( except for 6 KHz, so any 6KHz DMA sound on the STE won't work directly
on the Falcon, because the Falcon "emulates" the STE DMA sound ), but of
course also in mono.<br><br>
The systems stays completely intact.<br><br>

The Missing Link<br>
----------------<br><br>
Since STOS Maestro doesn't offer a very good replay routine, too much CPU
time is used and the mouse slows down the samples, the Missing Link offers
an own replay-command, called the digiplay command.<br><br>
Digiplay replays RAW (signed) samples from memory once or continuosly
in various speeds, needing less CPU-time than the Maestro command does.
The missing link also offers explicit commands how to play the samples 
without explicit knowledge of their speed or their address.<br><br>
Digiplay therefore could be seen as a replacement for maestro's replay-
commands but not for the Maestro record-commands.<br><br>
It is very much faster indeed and the mouse interrupt stays intact, at
least when playing lower frequency samples like for example 12 KHz, which
provides an alright quality.<br><br>
Digiplay only needs the Yamaha Soundchip of the ST.<br><br>

Other Extensions<br>
----------------<br><br>
There are some other extensions that may offer STE-DMA-Replay commands,
but mostly they work like the ones described under STE-Extensions, since
those commands normally only set a few registers and initiate replay and
therefore are rather easy to code. Besides the Missing Link i do not know
any extensions offering Sample-replay on an ordinary ST, but you may of
course correct me if i'm wrong ... ;-)<br><br>

<a name=chip>CHIP</A><p>
These files have several advantages, they are small, and can be packed to even smaller with an average size of 5k, yet the tunes are varied with many different sounds and last quite a long time before looping,Some have more than one tune in the same file, some have sound effects you can use for games, CHIP plays in the background and will not slow your program down, they can be used WITH sampled sound if you use the STe extensions,<p>
Chip music was all the rage in the day of the demo..Unfortunatly now a lot of people frown and immediatly turn to the volume OFF when chip music is detected, personally I think it is because they have heard so much over the years, and certainly not because of lack of quality,<p>
The best way to play CHIP is to use TML..That is the Missing Link Extension, this has MUSAUTO and MUSPLAY commands and is all you really need,<br> However some dont have TML or dont want it, you can play CHIP in basic,<p>
<br><br>

The Following Information has been written by Yiannis Paschalidis, The second part written by The Phantom<p>
Tracker modules<p>

Tracker modules (or mods) are files that contain a song and sound samples
of various instruments that are used to play the song. The samples usually
take up more space than the song pattern. The files can get quite large if
there are lots of samples contained in the file. I've seen sizes ranging from
2Kb up to 900Kb!<p> 

The music is usually 4 channel, and is played by mixing the sound samples
together in real time which can take up a lot of CPU time. Different pitches
are achieved by slightly altering the speed at which the sampled sound is
played back. <p>

There are a lot of different mod creators out there (noisetracker,
protracker, screamtracker,etc...), but you are usually safe when assuming a
file ending in ".mod" can be played from STOS using a modplayer extension. <p>

The sound quality you get and the CPU time required depends on the method you
use to play back the mod, however they will sound better than chip music. <p>

<center>Playing mods from within STOS</center>
<center>----------------------------</center>
<p>
<a name="abk"><center>The STOS tracker extension/ABK player (ST/STe)</a></center>
<center>----------------------------------------------</center>
<p>
On the ST, you don't have much of a choice unfortunately. There is only the
STOS Tracker extension. There are three STOS and Compiler extensions. Each
extension has a different playback frequency.<p>

<ul>
 <li>7Khz - The playback is not of high quality but more CPU time is <br>
left. This should be used for animation sequences etc.<p>

 <li> 14Khz - The playback is of better quality, but practically all of 
  the CPU time is used up. This should be used for static titles.<p>
 
   <li>10Khz - This is a good compromise between the above two.<p>
</ul>
This is only the general rule. Don't forget that when you compile your
program, it WILL run faster, but the Tracker will still use about the same
amount of processor time. <p>

Some speed tests showed that approximately half the CPU time is used for the
7KHz extension, and almost all CPU time is used with the 14Khz extension. 
This means that you can't really use the tracker extension to provide
background music in action games. Part of the reason for the lack of speed is
that not only does the tracker have to mix the samples for the music, it then
has to use the yamaha soundchip to play the resultant sample. <p>

Unfortunately, using this extension, you need to convert modfiles before you
can play them and extension also kills the ACIA interrupt. This means that
you can't read the keyboard mouse or joystick(s).STOS's sprite interrupts are
left intact. The tracker extension does, however, provide a function to read
the keyboard. If your computer has DMA sound (STe / Falcon, etc..) then you
can play sound samples using DMA while tracker music is playing. <p>

The STOS-Tracker package includes the three STOS & Compiler extensions, a
utility to convert NOISE TRACKER (Amiga or ST) modules to STOS-Tracker format
and a couple of demonstration programs.<p> 


<center>Ninja tracker extension: (STe/TT/Falcon)</center>
<center>----------------------------------------</center>
<p>
Similar to the STOS tracker extension, but it uses the DMA sound system to
play the mixed-sample rather than the soundchip, which speeds things up
significantly! It has the advantage of being able to play modfiles without
conversion (although it does need 20Kb after the modfile data as a
workspace). It also disables ACIA interrupts. The Ninja tracker extension
lets you play back mods at up to 21Khz. Unlike STOS tracker, the playback
frequency is set with one of the extension's commands instead of having to
mess around with separate extensions. <p>

As with the Tracker extension, better playback quality chews up more CPU
time. You can use the soundchip while a mod is playing to play sound samples. <p>

The Ninja tracker package includes the interpreter and compiler versions of
the extension (the compiler version being *significantly* smaller than the
interpreter version!) and a demonstration program. <p>


<center>Falcon tracker extension (Falcon)</center>
<center>-----------------------------------</center>

NOTE:<br>
<i>
 It's not an extension... but I've got the sourcecode if anybody wants 
wrap it up into an extension - perhaps include it in the Falcon 
 extension? It needs a bit of changing, as I had included modules & 
 samples as part of the program so I could just call the program with the
 number of the sample/mod I wanted to play. I'll post the sourcecode to 
 anyone who wants it. It's 6k zipped. </i></b><b><p>

This uses Bitmaster's DSP modplayer for playback of mods. The playback is
50KHz and since it uses the DSP for mixing the samples and the Falcon DMA for
output, it uses virtually no CPU time. It also lets you play samples using
the DMA, but the music is temporarily shut off while the sample plays. You
can, however, play samples with the music in the same way as with the Ninja
extension. The playback routine is cleaner than the others, and doesn't
affect any of STOS's interrupts. <p>

The Following Information from The Phantom<p>
<P>These sound files are better in sound quality than chip music files but take up more CPU time. MOD files can be quite large but can be packed down to a lot smaller size. </P>
<P>MODS are now one of the, if not the, best music replay formats avalible for the Atari series of Computers they can sound good and don't make people turn down the volume or turn the music off stright away ( And they sound great from 25 watt speakers attached to the STE outputs with full bass and volume! :) )</P>
<P>They have the added advantage of not having to be converted unlike ABK files and the sound quality is better with more CPU time left.</P>
<P>Depending on what computer you have will depend on witch replay method used.</P>

<P>With any computer you can use two replay methods both of which are MC programs. The first is a MC program whic appeared on STOSSER 17 which used all the time availble but the MODS sounded great. The other method is a MC program which came with a Missing Link disk from Goodmans PDL with this MC program you had to assemble the MC program you self but you just had to change the the name of the inculed MOD file.</P>

<H2><A NAME="STE">STE and Falcons</A></H2>
<P>With and STE or greater you can use the Ninja Tracker Extension which lets you replay at either 5, 8.5 ,12 ,14 ,16 or 21 KHz on ANY STE+ with a DMA sound system. Depending on the quailty of the play back that you want will determine how fast you have the replay and how much CPU time you have left. You can still play samples using vaious replay commands but I'm as yet to test a DMA sample with it running.</P>

<H1><A NAME="Falcons">Falcons Only</A></H1>
<P>With the Falcon there are two main ways of replaying MODS. The first is with a MC program witch replays @ 50 KHz using the DSP sound system and use virtually no CPU time. The other is a command in Anthony's Falcon Extension which I have no info about as I don't have a Falcon :(</P>
