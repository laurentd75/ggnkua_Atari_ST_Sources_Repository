   Welcome to the aSTronomer! This is a completely integrated, full
featured astronomical program which gives you accurate information for
any date, any time at any location on Earth.
   To set your latitude and longitude, choose the latitude or longitude
option from the desktop, and enter the degrees, minutes of arc and
seconds of arc for your locality (your post office should carry this
information if you do not know). Also tell the computer if you are East
or West of the Greenwich meridian by entering an uppercase E or W, and
if you are North or South latitude by entering an uppercase N or S.
   For the date, enter the year, month (a number from 1 to 12), and the
day. The time is much the same, simply enter the hour and minute, in
Universal Time (the local time plus the number of hours west of the
Greenwich meridian). For all input boxes, please click OK to have the
computer register the newly entered data!
   For the printout option, click the Print Out option once. This will
toggle the check mark on the Print Out option. If you want to remove
this option, simply click the Print Out option again. A check mark on
White Screen indicates black stars / white sky. Click to invert screen.
   For more complete instructions, see the accompanying instructions
in the article.
