eXtended more V1.0 by Gregory Mathias Lemperle-Kerr


	For use with Gemini/Mupfel & maybe Gulam.

	I use Gemini/Mupfel, so I can't guarantee Gulam will work.  If
shellp is past as a pointer to a null null terminated set of null terminated
VARIABLE=VALUE type strings, it will work.

	I originally started this as a more that would work with .PI3 files.
It still does that as well as .DOO files.  If you put the line:

alias more xmore

into your mupfel.mup or gemini.mup or gulam.g files, and place xmore.ttp into
one of your paths in $PATH, xmore will replace the more command.  It will
display degas and doodle pictures on its own, but after a frustrating bout
with .IMG displaying, I decided that there were enough external programs
that do a better job.  XMORE will search through the environment variables
for a variable of the form: MORE???=path\program,arg.  The ???'s can be 1-3
characters or nonexistant.  The extension of the program chosen will decide
which program will view it.  For example, in my mupfel.mup file, I have:

alias more xmore
setenv MOREDFT E:\BIN\MORE.TTP
setenv MOREDOC E:\TEMPUS.APP
setenv MORETXT C:\AUTO\QUICK\QVIEW.PRG
setenv MOREARC E:\BIN\ARC.TTP,v
setenv MORELZH E:\BIN\LZH.TTP,v
setenv MOREZOO E:\BIN\ZOO.TTP,v
setenv MOREPS  G:\USCRIPT\USCRIPT.PRG

(notice the MOREDFT which sets the default viewer if none of the extensions
	match that of the file)

I suppose the dvi viewer could be set up to take dvi files also.

Turbo C 2.0 source is included.


Have fun.
