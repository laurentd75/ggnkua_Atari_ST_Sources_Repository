			  UW (Unix (tm) Windows) ST
		A Windowing Terminal Emulator for the Atari ST

This program was written by Hans-Martin Mosner at the University of
Dortmund in West Germany.  It has since been enhanced by Brad Bosch
and Brian Katzung at Lachman Associates, Inc., in Naperville, Illinois.
We have added quite a lot, including

	o keyboard and mouse locking,
	o simple text capture,
	o kermit file transfer in a uw window,
	o subprocess execution,
	o function-key support,
	o RS232 configuration,
	o additional fonts, and
	o printer support.

Limitations:
	o only supports monochrome systems
	o only supports adm31 emulation
	  (but the emulation has been "enhanced"--see README)
	o only supports the minimum UW protocol

We have spent a great deal of effort trying to work out or around bugs
in GEM, HMM's code, and our code, but I'm sure some have succeeded in
eluding us even though this code has been in use at Lachman Associates
for over a year.
