This file shows how to write level files for GEM Sokoban.

The format for levels is as follows:
	
	wall is			#
	goal is			.
	empty cell is		space
	box is			$ or o
	box on goal is		*
	player is 		@
	player on goal is	+
	
Any line which does not start with a wall or box-on-goal character is 
ignored (treated as a blank line).  So you can add comments around your 
levels as you wish - as in this tutorial.

Here is the simplest level.
#####
#@$.#
#####
Note that the player should not be able to escape the walls.

A slightly larger level is:

#####################
#                   #
#   $          $    #
#         @         #
#        . .        #
#                   #
#####################

When you load a set of levels into GEM Sokoban, the file name is used 
as the name for that set of levels, and the levels are numbered as they 
appear in the file.

If you edit a set of levels, you may need to delete its entry in the 
scores file, to maintain consistency.
