ABOUT MINES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The game of mines is about crossing a mine field. The field is a rectangle
of 16x16 squares. Some of them are save and some of them contain a mine.
The total number of mines hidden in the field can be set by the player
before a game starts. The only clue given by the program about the
position of the mines is the number of mines within one square distance.
While walking the field the player will collect more and more information
about where mines are located.
The aim is to reach the lower right corner of the field marked "OK".


MOVING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
You move to a square by clicking it with the left mouse button.
The squares visited by you will turn gray and once you have left if
a small digit will indicate the number of mines near to that position.
You can move to any square within one square distance of the gray area.


INDICATORS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to indicate a square as "save" you can do so by clicking the
left mouse button while pressing the <alt> key. Likewise, you can indicate
"unsave" squares with the right mouse button while pressing the <alt> key.
You can remove the indicators in the same way.
Squares marked "unsave" are prohibited territory: Mines won't allow you
to step on a mine indicator.


YOU DIE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you accidently step on a mine you die. Mines will show the placement
of the mines and the path it generated for you before he places the bombs.


QUITING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can quit the current game any time by pressing both <shift> keys.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was inspired to implement MINES by a version of Tom Anderson running on
a Sun workstation. I don't know if Tom is the original creator of the game.

COLOR VERSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
If somebody owning a color monitor ports the program please sent me the
diffs.
