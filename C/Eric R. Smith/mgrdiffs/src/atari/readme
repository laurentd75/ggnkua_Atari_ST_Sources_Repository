This is the Atari version of the bit-blit library. It uses the line A
routines in ROM, and hence can use the hardware blitter if it is present
and has been activated.
It's been tested an works in monochrome and medium resolution. The line
and pixel routines can get confused in low resolution, but I haven't bothered
trying to track down the problem, since running MGR in low res. is a bit
silly.
