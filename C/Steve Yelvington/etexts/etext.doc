ETEXT.PRG
ETEXT.ACC

	This program (or desk accessory) converts standard
EMACS-style ASCII text files into a format that can be imported
into PageStream documents. The ASCII import function of PageStream
(at least in the version I use) can't deal with any normal ASCII
text file I have ever seen. Rather than whine at the authors
of PageStream, I wrote this GEM-based filter program, which
I am placing in the public domain.

	You will be prompted for the name of the original
file and the name of an output file. The program copies the
text intact, but eliminates line endings except for the ends of
paragraphs. The resulting file can be imported into PageStream
with the ASCII import feature.

ETEXT.C

	The source code, suitable for Sozobon C.

MAKEFILE

	A makefile for creating both .PRG and .ACC versions
in conjunction with Sozobon C, dLibs and GEMFAST.

DACC.O
DACC.S

	A desk accessory startup module, object and source code.
