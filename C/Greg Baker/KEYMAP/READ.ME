
Keymap.prg reads the current keyboard translate tables from memory and creates
'C' source code that can be used in programs.

Keymap.prg is designed to run under a shell.

if you run it from the desktop it will display the tables on the screen and
then return to the desktop.

if your shell has redirection the you can send the output to the printer or
a file. (keymap >keymap.h)
