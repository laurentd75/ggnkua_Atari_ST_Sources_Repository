[This is a document Rayan and I whipped up to answer some of the
 queries about map entries -- hopefully, it'll reduce the number of
 map entries that need to be manually corrected and fixed up.  We
 would appreciate it if the old hands at the map entry game also read
 this to see if we missed anything or got it wrong. - Mark.]

Introduction

The UUCP map is a database of information about hosts that communicate
by UUCP.  The primary purpose is to document possible routes for
mail.  When the "pathalias" program is run on the UUCP map data, it
outputs the most efficient path from a specified host (usually your
own) to all other hosts listed in the map.  Most ``smart'' mail
programs on the UUCP network can use the pathalias output to route mail
without the user having to specify explicit routes.


Registering your site

To register a site in the UUCP map, fill out an entry in the format
described below, and mail it to the registry address.

Canadian sites should mail to

		utai!path
or
		path@cs.toronto.edu

or, if the time of first registration is critical to reserve a name, to

		rutgers!uucpmap

Do not send to both, as the only function of rutgers!uucpmap is to record
your submission and retransmit it to utai!path.  If you wish to register
your site as a subdomain under the Canadian top-level domain (.CA), please
contact utai!registry or registry@cs.toronto.edu for information.


Format of a map entry
---------------------

A generic UUCP map entry looks like:

#N	sitename[, sitenames, domains]
#S	manufacturer machine model; [operating system & version]
#O	organization name
#C	contact person(s) name(s)
#E	contact person(s) electronic mail address(es)
#T	contact person(s) telephone number(s)
#P	organization's address
#L	latitude / longitude
#R	optionally a one line remark
#U	netnews neighbors separated by spaces [more than one such line
#U	is ok if you have more neighbours than will fit on one line]
#W	address of the person who last edited the entry ; date last edited
#
#	additional comments go here.  As many lines as you want.
#	Equivalencing your site to a domain name is optional -- if
#	you want to register a domain name, do so with the
#	proper authorities running the domain in question.
#
sitename	.domain(LOCAL)
sitename	remote1(FREQUENCY), remote2(FREQUENCY),
		remote3(FREQUENCY)

The lines beginning with '#' are comments to pathalias, which will
ignore them.  Lines beginning with '#' immediately followed by an
upper case letter have specific formats and are used by other programs
that process map data.  Lines beginning with '#' immediately followed
by a space or tab are comments that are ignored.

The #[letter] must be followed by a TAB character (ASCII code 011
octal, often represented as \t in C programs and some documents) -- do
not use spaces instead.

Keep all lines to under 80 columns -- the maps have to be sent through
machines that can be actively hostile to long lines.


Examples of map entries:

[These examples were taken from the maps in October 1990.  They do
 not reflect the current status of those sites]

The first example, for site "iceman", is a simple map entry -- it has
a single UUCP connection to another site, "alberta".

#N	iceman
#S	AT&T UNIX-pc 3B1; SYSV Rel. 2 Ver. 3.51
#O	private site
#C	Michel Adam
#E	iceman!michel
#T	+1 403 920 8792
#P	301 Ptarmigan, 42 Con Rd., Yellowknife, N.W.T., Canada X1A 1X6
#L	62 27 43 N / 114 26 04 W
#R
#U	
#W	iceman!michel (Michel Adam); Wed Mar  7 00:31:25 MST 1990
#
iceman        alberta(DAILY)


Site "tmsoft", the second example, is a slightly more complicated map
entry.  It has a lot of UUCP feeds for both mail and news,
more than one modem, and therefore prioritizes its links.

#N	tmsoft
#S	National Semiconductor ICM3216; Unix System 5r2

The third example is of a site that has associated domain names in
different domains, several long distance feeds and connects via a Local
Area Network to several other sites.  See the pathalias manual page
for details about Local Area Networks.

Note that a large site listing internal hosts like this is frowned on.
In general, internal hosts should not be mentioned in the UUCP map unless
they do not use an organizational domain name for outgoing mail.  Any host
that gateways between the UUCP network at large, and your organization,
should have its own UUCP map entry.


Each field in the map entry is documented in detail in the README
file posted periodically to comp.mail.maps.  The following
notes are additional clarifications or suggestions.

The machine name must be unique within the first six characters.  It
may only have lower case alphanumerics or hyphens in it.  You may not
use a name that someone else has already registered with their map
entry.

Check the present set of maps in comp.mail.maps for the current set of
names in use (grep '^#N' u.* should find them all) Else ask your
regional map coordinator.  [We hope to eventually have an automatic
mail server in place for answering questions like "is name foobar taken?"]

Choose a name that you would like to stay with for a long while --
changing the name of the machine people associate you with can be very
inconvenient for your e-mail correspondents and for you.  Remember that
people will use the name in conversation.

Some hints for choosing a machine name [adapted from the Internet
RFC1178 by Don Libes]

	Don't overload other terms already in common use - it confuses people.
	Don't choose a name after a project unique to that machine - the
		machine may get used for another project.
	Don't use your own name. -- it confuses people.
	Avoid alternate spellings or hard-to-pronounce words. -- you'd be
		surprised how much mail bounces because of such names.
	Avoid names very similar to other names -- it confuses people.
	Don't use antagonistic or otherwise embarrassing names.
	Don't use digits at the beginning of the name - it confuses programs.
	Don't use non-alphanumeric characters in a name - it confuses programs.
	Use words/names that are rarely used - uniqueness is nice.
	Use theme names - if you're naming more than one machine.
	Use real words - people can remember and spell them easily.
	There is always room for an exception.

Remember to provide a trailing semi-colon on the operating system
field (#S) even if you do not provide an operating system.

In the telephone field (#T) do not put spaces between the 'x' and the
extension number, if any.  Do not put dashes, parenthesis, or any
other characters in the phone number.  The format is standard for
international phone numbers, e.g., +1 800 555 1212.

Please do provide your latitude and longitude as accurately as you
can.  It is useful for maps of the network, especially in cities with
a lot of UUCP sites.

Remember to add your province in the address in the #P field.  The
accepted two letter or three letter abbreviation is fine, or the full
name. We sort map entries by province.

When you submit an updated map entry, remember to update the date on
the #W field.  The preferred date format is the output of the Unix
date(1) command.  Specifying the date in GMT is a good way to avoid
ambiguity in time zone names.  (You can instead put your local time
zone in a comment or remark, specifying how far ahead of behind GMT it
is)

Pathalias can deal with mail routes specified with !, %, : and @ as
routing characters.  However, UUCP maps entries must only use !  as a
routing character.  This makes the output of pathalias unambiguous to
all mailers.
