Howdy. This is rmgr, my program for managing multiple remote sessions
thru a single communications line (e.g., a dial-up serial port). The
header file rmgr.h tries to #include <mgr/term.h>, so you will need to
have the MGR client library header files installed in a reasonable spot,
like /usr/include/mgr. (Or just add the -Ipath option to the Makefile
and fake it...)

This program is derived from Oliver Laumann's "screen" program, and has
nearly the same system requirements as that program. (I.e., BSD sockets
and pseudo-ttys are necessary.) Plus, obviously, the console you are
sitting in front of must be running an MGR server for you to use this
program at all.

I am calling this a beta-release, although the program is very stable
and I don't expect many problems to crop up. (But read the man page,
you may find that the "features" I note could hamper your use... You're
welcome to tackle the two noted problems and tell me how it went.)
