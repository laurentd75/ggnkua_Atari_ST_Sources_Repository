    SYNOPSIS
        rsctoc.ttp rsc_file [-p prefix] [-o file]

    DESCRIPTION
        Rsctoc is a program to generate C code from a resource file on an
        Atari St computer.  It will handle the following types; OBJECT,
        TEDINFO, ICONBLK and BITBLK.  If the command is executed with only
        a path to the rsc_file then the C code will be displayed on the
        screen.  To send the output to a file you can use the '-o file'
        option or to redirect the output with '>file'.

        The C code that is generated includes a small routine to fixup the
        objects by calling rsrc_obfix() on each object to convert the
        object's location size from character coordinates to pixel coordinates. 
        The routine is that is called to fixup the objects is 'fix_objects()'
        and should be called once during program initialization (calling it
        more than once is interesting but not useful).

        The -p prefix option is used to add a short unique prefix to the names
        of the structures, routine and macros that rsctoc creates.  This is
        very useful when creating library routines that have trees embedded
        in them (providing a means of preventing name conflicts).

        If rsctoc is executed in the following way

                   rsctoc rsc_file -p my -o file

        Then the C code generated would have 'my' added to the start of the
        structures, routine and macros.

                   rs_tedinfo      would be      myrs_tedinfo
                   NUM_TI          would be      myNUM_TI
                   fix_objects     would be      myfix_objects

    NOTES
        The program DOES NOT generate the arrays rs_strings[], rs_frstr[],
        rsfrimg[], or rs_imdope[] arrays.  The program DOES generate the
        arrays rs_tedinfo[], rs_object[], rs_trindex[], rs_bitblk[],
        rs_iconblk[] arrays as well as defines the macros NUM_TI, NUMOBS,
        NUM_TREE, NUM_BB and NUM_IB (modified by the prefix of course).

        Any names that you assigned to objects, trees, images or icons can
        still be used in your program to access these elements. The program
        will only handle 512 trees (not objects, images or icons which are
        only limited by the resource file structure) in one input resource
        file.

    BUGS
        There are no known bugs in V1.0. (:->)
        If you find one fix it.
