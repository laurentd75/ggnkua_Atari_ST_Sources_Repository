Atari, in their wisdom, have created a situation where there are many
different types of STs in people's homes and offices. What have we got
in Britain (TT not included)?

There are 4 different legally released operating systems (TOS), 1.0 (ROM
TOS), 1.2 (Blitter TOS), 1.4 (Rainbow TOS), 1.6 (STE TOS).

There are 2 versions of GEMDOS, 0.19 (TOS 1.0 and 1.2) and 0.21 (TOS 1.4
and 1.6).

There are 2 versions of the AES, 1.20 (TOS 1.0 and 1.2) and 1.40 (TOS 1.4 and
1.6).

There are 2 versions of GDOS though you should only use Release 1.1.

There are 15 different nationalities of ROM.

STs either have a Blitter chip fitted or not.

There are 3 different resolutions (Overscan and graphics cards excluded)
and many different amounts of RAM memory from 256 K to 4 Mb.  I'll leave
it to you to work out all the different combinations.

All this can create problems for software developers and subsequent 'bug'
troubleshooters.  If you ring up or write to your software company for some
technical advice, reporting a bug or undocumented 'feature', it is of great
help to them to know what system the program is running on.  HiSoft provide
a program called CHECKST.PRG which provides them with this information but
it is not Public Domain.  I have therefore written this program which does
the same thing for all you non-HiSoft software users!  It is called
ST_TYPE.TOS and comes with the source code in HiSoft Lattice C v5 -
ST_TYPE.C.

Just double-click on ST_TYPE.TOS to run it.  You will be given the choice
at the end to print the information to your printer by pressing 'P' (make
sure the printer is on-line, of course) or quit.  This program should run
on all STs and in all resolutions.  Very simple but very useful, I hope.
