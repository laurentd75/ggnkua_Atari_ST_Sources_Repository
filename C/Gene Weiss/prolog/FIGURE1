    Input: two clauses term1 and term2, represented as lists
    Output: success or faiure, with variable bindings as a
side-effect

    unify(term1,term2)

    if term1 is a variable
         bind term1 to term2
         return SUCCESS
    else if term2 is a variable
         bind term2 to term1
         return SUCCESS

    else if term1 is a constant or term2 is a constant {compare the
constants}
         if term1 = term2
              return SUCCESS
         else
              return FAILURE
    else {term1 and term2 are lists - try to unify their heads}
         if unify(head(term1),head(term2) {the heads unified; how
about the rest?}
              return unify(tail(term1),tail(term2)
         else {the heads wouldn't unify)
              return FAILURE
