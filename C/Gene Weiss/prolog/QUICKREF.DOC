built-in           description

head               returns the head of a list
tail               returns the tail of a list
read               reads input from console
write              writes to console
true               always succeeds
fail               always fails
exit               exits from G-PROLOG
call               tries to prove a goal
=                  tests for numerical equality
>                  tests for numerical superiority
<>                 tests for numerical inequality
>                  tests for numerical superiority
>=                 tests for numerical superiority or equality
<=                 tests for numerical inferiority or equality
is                 makes arithmetic assignments (+,-,*,/,MOD)
cons               constructs a nex list with specified head and tail
same               tests for list equality
different          tests for list inequality
list               lists the current database on the console
