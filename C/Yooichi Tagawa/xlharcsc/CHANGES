Version 1.2
-----------
*Changed the name from LHarc to Xlharc.
*Some of the compression functions have been converted to assembly language
 and generally improved.
*Fixed a bug in the time conversion routine.  Now xlharc will show proper
 time in lzh archives made by other LHarcers.
*Adapted the msdos sfx code to include PFXPAK-type archives. (PFXPAK is an
 executable packer that is based on LARC)
*Converted time/date display format to International standard.
*Changed stack size from using all available memory to a fixed amount.  This
 was for better compatibilty with MiNT.
*Added 'f' command.  Freshen archive.  Thanks to Kai Uwe Rommel.

Version 1.02
------------
*Rewrote interface between the desktop and the actual LHarc program.  Will
 now expand wildcards and properly convert the desktop command line into a
 more UN*X like command line.
*Changed the temporary dir variable from TMP to ARCTEMP.  This was for
 ArcShell compatiblity.
*Added the 'h' option.  Removed shell_p test.
*Added the 'b' option.  This cause backups of archives to be turned on.
*Changed the meaning of the 'z' option.  It's function is now determined by
 where you have launched the program from, desktop or CLI shell.  This is an
 attempt to keep both GEM and shell users happy.  See docs for more info.
*Fixed multiple bugs in the delete from archive function.
*Hacked around a bug in the new ARGV standard, set by Atari, that prevents a
 program from being launched more than once from the desktop when the fast
 bit is set.  Thanks alot bammi!

Version 1.01
------------
*Hacked up the command line in order to gain ARCSHELL compatibilty.
*Added 't' command. Test archive integrity.
*Fixed a bug in the original source that prevented adding more than 61 files
 per directory.  Now it should be limited only by memory and disk space.

Version 1.00  - Never released to the public
------------
*Initial Atari ST port from the UN*X V0.03 source.
*Changed command structure from UN*X to MS-DOS wherever possible.
*Added TMP dir support - Should help floppy systems, not much for HD.
*Added shell_p test to see where LHarc was launched from.
