Please feel free to distribute DeskClock to anyone, as long as all the 
files remain together, including this DOC file.

Disclaimer: Use this software at your own risk. It has been tested on 
several computers with several TOS versions and with Geneva. At the time 
I'm writing this, there is no known bug but this doesn't mean there aren't 
any... I make no waranty whatsoever on the working of DeskClock.

I would nevertheless appreciate any comment you may have about it.



Now, how does it work? Simple:  On any Atari system using AES prior to 
4.0, place the DESKCLOC.ACC in your boot drive. This will normally be 
drive C:\ for hard disk users and A:\ for floppy users. You can also place 
it in your ACCS\ folder if you're using a TSR to allow loading of 
accessories from a separate folder.

If you're using a version of AES of 4.0 or greater, you can use the clock 
as a PRG, in a multitasking environment. (rename the file as necessary) Do 
not try to put it in your AUTO folder, DeskClock is a GEM application! Add 
this line to your GEM.CNF file:

run z:\path\deskcloc.prg

where z:\path\ is the actual path of the program.

Note that you can still use it as an ACC. The reason you might want to 
use DeskClock as a PRG is if you use tear off menus in Geneva or another 
AES environment allowing it. In this case, DeskClock will issue a 
menu_register() everytime the clock updates to provoque a redraw of the 
tear offs. This is only possible with PRGs.

Note: DeskClock does NOT look if it's running on AES 4.0 before issuing the 
call. If you try to run it as a PRG under older systems, you will very 
likely get a system crash.

If you click on the menu entry, you will get an information alert.

Note 2: DeskClock checks the time every two seconds, but only updates the 
menu entry everytime the minutes change. This means you might get as much 
as a two second delay between DeskClock and the actual system time. This 
was done to keep system usage to a minimum.

The program/accessory sources are included. They are there as a learning 
too and to allow anyone interested to modify the code for their own use. 
I'm not really proud of it and it's not as neatly formatted as I'd like 
but this was a learning project. If it can be of use to anyone...

ALP!
