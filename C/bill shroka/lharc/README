here is a complete atariST or Unix compilable lharc, with complete sources.
the atariST tos implementation was severly hacked over by bill shroka,
to have all the usual additional tos arc/lharc options available. he
also fixed it up to work correctly with bullshit clickity/clack  gem-based
shells like arcshell.prg, the gem desktop and other such brain death.

thanks bill.

TOS compiling:
	make -f Makefile.tos
Unix:
	edit & configure Makefile
	make -f Makefile

Tos usage note:
	when used from a shells like gulam, the 'z' option (pack in sub dirs)
is the default. specifying z turns it off.

	when used from the desk top `z' turns *on* the option.
