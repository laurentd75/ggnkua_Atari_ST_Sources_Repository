The "nrchbar" program effectively inserts n/troff-style change bar commands
into files which are (presumably) n/troff source.  For more information,
consult the man page.

To install "nrchbar":

1)	Inspect "Makefile" for proper destinations (currently,
	"/usr/local/bin" for the binary and "/usr/man/manl" for the man
	page).  Correct these if necessary.  If "diff" on your system isn't
	"/bin/diff", you'll also need to modify the "DIFFPROG" #define in
	"nrchbar.c".  "nrchbar" assumes "getopt" is present, so you'll need
	to contact your friendly neighborhood comp.sources.unix archive if it
	isn't.

2)	In the source directory:
		
		% make install

3)	If everything goes well, still in the source directory:

		% make clean

I claim that this program was written entirely by me, entitling me (with the
approval of my management) to release it into the public domain, which I now
do.  However, I make no warrantees, either express or implied, on "nrchbar"
or its associated files and I do not assume responsiblity for any damages
resulting from its installation or use.

The software has only been compiled and tested on a Sun 3/50, but I don't
expect any major problems on other UNIX machines, including System V.

In spite of the disclaimer above, I'd like to hear about bugs and/or feature
requests.
