90Oct19  ***** Increm restarted (continued from increm.1) *****
	-citnet\ directory nuked (go to backups if we ever need that stuff)
	-most conversion stuff removed from citalt\ (ditto ----^ )

90Oct22  citadel 1.30-34
	-In initCitadel(), replaced call to modemInit() with call to hangup()
	 to ensure carrier termination.  Deleted function modemInit().
	 [rooma.c, modem.c]
	-Added code to copymessage() to archive messages being copied/moved
	 into an archived room.  Stole code from notemessage().  [msg.c]
	-Added new MIN, MAX and SANE #define limits for cfg.maxrooms,
	 .mailslots, .sharedrooms and .logsize (which used to be .MAXLOGTAB).
	 Modified all change.tos programs to check these limits.  Did the
	 same for configur.tos.  [ctdl.h, cfg.c, rchange.c, lchange.c,
	 nchange.c, mchange.c, plus 1000's for the MAXLOGTAB alteration]
	-Eliminated guts of code for .U(ngoto) in doUngoto() and retRoom().
	 That command now just mimics [U]ngoto.  [ctdl.c, rooma.c]
	-[U]ngoto command code in retRoom() now has a paranoid check to make
	 sure a user backing up into the Aide> room still has Aide privs.
	 [rooma.c]

90Oct27	 citadel 1.30-35
	-In showMessages(), changed mail receipt flag update code so it doesn't
	 update messages for TheSysop.  Added new command to promptmsg() (.RM)
	 called [M]ark-received, which TheSysop can use to mark messages as
	 received.  [msg.c]

90Oct31  citadel 1.30-36
	-Added #roomdir and moved all roomfile references to it.  [ctdl.h,
	 cfg.[ch], getroom.c, putroom.c, rchange.c, citpeek.c, ctdlcnfg.doc]
	-Added new cfg flag "SHOWRECD" to control display of "Rec'd" flag in
	 mail for non-TheSysop() users.  [flags.h, cfg.c, printmsg.c]
	-Added support for <fnord>adel Developer Fields to getmessage() and
	 getspool(), plus putspool() and putmessage().  [msgio2.c, getspool.c,
	 postmsg.c]

90Nov01  citadel 1.30-37
	-Munged in some stuff from 3.4a.  [libroute.c]

#
# Port to gcc!
#
90Nov02  citadel 1.31-0
	-Ported citadel to gcc.  Also munged in more piles of stuff from
	 STadel 3.4a, including room.c, msg.c, some floor.c, misc.c and lots
	 of ancillary stuff too picky & numerous to detail.
	-Lots of low-level code made ANSI-compatible, including time functions,
	 addition of function prototypes, liberal application of void and
	 static declarations where needed, etc.

90Nov25  citadel 1.31-1
	-Lots of bug fixing.  First beta version actually runnable.

90Dec03  citadel 1.31-2
	-Made "(n left)" user-configurable in putheader().  [misc.c, log.c,
	 flags.h]
	-Fixed ld-credit bug in canreply() that was preventing reply to net-
	 mail.  [msg.c]
	-Prettified the "More?" and "Aide?" prompts and associated stuff.
	 [msg.c]
	-Fixed up the restoration of rooms being ungotoed into by flagging them
	 with iNEVER status.  In ungoto().  [ctdl.c]
	-Made statroom() use iprintf().  [room.c]
	-Attempted a fix of the message output format routines, to prevent
	 occasional spurious leading spaces.  In outspaces().  [format.c]
	-Reenabled echoing of "more" commands for experts, in tailmesg().
	 Eliminated a function message() which then had no use.  [msg.c]

90Dec04  citadel 1.31-3
	-Additional change to outspaces() trying to get the formatter right.
	 [format.c]
	-Altered the non-expert version of the "more" prompt to be a bit more
	 (as it were) complete, in tailmesg().  [msg.c]

90Dec04  citadel 1.31-4
	-Beautification: CR after [S]top, CR after whazzit(), `exit' on [X]
	 in configure(), changed leading spaces in statroom(), and fixed up
	 the <fnord>s.  [msg.c, misc.c, doenter.c, room.c, ctdl.c].

90Dec05  citadel 1.31-5
	-Changed a SomeSysop() to TheSysop() in canEnter().  [room.c]
	-Modified struct dirList a bit, and a few places where its _date parts
	 are used. [dirlist.h, doread.c, scandir.c, getdiren.c.  Obsoleted
	 dta.h].

	-Got citpeek.tos working.

90Dec06  citadel 1.31-6
	-Fixed bug with default destination room for message [M]ove & [C]opy,
	 in copymessage().  [msg.c]
	-Misc. cosmetic hacks.  [login.c, room.c]
	-Fixed bug in listFloor() that caused ;K to inherit the partial room
	 name spec left over from a previous .K.  [floor.c]
	-Fixed bug in copymessage() that caused the [C]opy command to lock up
	 after doing its thing.  [msg.c]
	-Fixed changepw() so it doesn't echo a user's new password to the
	 console when entered.  [log.c]

90Dec08  citadel 1.31-7
	-Debug logging added, tied to Debug variable; init code in main(),
	 changing code in dosysop().  [ctdl.c, dosysop.c]
	-Made use of the above to start tracking the logout lockup bug.
	 [log.c, misc.c]
	-Changed dosexec() to use spawnv() instead of execv() as per ERS'
	 suggestion.  [sysdep.c]
	-Got clog working (mostly.)  [clog.c]

90Dec11  citadel 1.31-8
	-Fixed improper readbit() call glitch in loadnet.tos.  [loadnet.c]
	-Fixed various additional utility glitches (e.g. attempts to include
	 non-existent "msg.h", conversion of msgBuf.mbid from a string to a
	 long int, messing with time-related stuff, etc.)
	-Minor tweaks to some relatively user-hostile blurbs; now more verbose
	 for non-experts.  See statroom(), givePrompt().  [room.c,misc.c]
	-Misc help file improvements.
	-Added debugging (tied to Debug) to outspaces() to try to find the
	 logout.blb lockup bug.  [format.c]
	 Followup:  The problem is with fgets() in writeformatted(), only after
	 a door has been run.  Something in the dup2() or fgets() gcc stuff is
	 buggered.
	-Added "maxmsg.blb" to doEnter(), which gets output when users reach
	 their message entry limit in a room.  [doenter.c]
	-Added hooks to canreply() and createmesg() so that SomeSysop() will be
	 prompted once for a new recipient when replying to net-mail from a
	 node that isn't in the system's node list.  [msg.c]
	-Added new configur binary parameter in setvariable() and modIn() to
	 control whether console users get logged off the system by lack of
	 keyboard activity.  [cfg.c,modem.c,flags.h]
	-#if'ed out all traces of mirrorDir feature.  [cfg.c,misc.c,postmsg.c,
	 msgio.c,popular.c,citpeek.c,ctdl.h,citlib.h,cfg.h,flags.h]
	-Removed a #define for dup2().  [sysdep.h]
	-Added hook to writeformatted() to properly abort a file display when
	 the user hits [S]top.  [misc.c]
	-Aides can no longer use the remote-Sysop password.  Only Sysops.
	 In doSysop().  [dosysop.c]
	-Wiped out .A(ide) I(nsert) from doAide().  [ctdl.c]
	-Re-wiped-out .U(ngoto) handling code in ungoto().  [ctdl.c]

90Dec14  citadel 1.31-09
	-Expanded purge functionality to take out designated incoming net
	 traffic in shared rooms (not net-mail).  New function donetpurge(),
	 called in doNetRooms().  Any purgeID in the purge list that is a
	 substring of a net message's author (to handle foo!bar!scit), or an
	 exact match of the origin node name (to allow purging an entire node;
	 good for backbone systems), will cause the given message to be tossed
	 out.  A diagnostic message is displayed during the net session, and
	 logged to the netlog file, if active.  [netrcv.c]
	-Net passwords are now displayed by [V]iew, in showNode(), when
	 editting a net node.  [netmisc.c]
	-Removed references to defunct include file dta.h from some utilities.
	-.R(ead) U(ser) now does a substring search for the target user name,
	 in legitimate().  [msg.c]
	-Fixed minor glitch introduced in -08 involving spurious secondary
	 prompts for a recipient in Mail>.  New parameter to createmesg() to
	 indicate if created message is the result of a [R]eply command, or
	 not.  [msg.c]

90Dec15  citadel 1.31-10
	-Added support for Citadel-86 style net passwords to slavemode(),
	 netlogin() and caller().  [netcall.c,netrcv.c,ctdlnet.h]
	-Fixed STadel-based bug that let normal networking proceed if a remote
	 net password was defined, but the remote system didn't send one to be
	 checked.  Hit various functions, see esp. slavemode().  [netcall.c,
	 netrcv.c,citadel.h]
	-Added [V]iew command to ^LU menu in dostatus(); displays various
	 status flags and l-d credits.  [dosysop.c]
	-Fixed configur bug in msginit() that put ctdlmsg.sys in sysDir when
	 configuring a new system.  [cfg.c]
	-Fixed bug in showMessages() preventing proper display of policy.hlp
	 for unlogged-in users in Mail>.  [msg.c]
	-Fixed orc bug in gotoname() that caused trashing of logBuf gen values
	 when .G was used to go into non-public rooms.  [room.c]

90Dec25  citadel 1.31-11
	-More fixing in getnetlogin() to handle the fact that Cit-86 pads net
	 packets with spaces instead of nulls.  [netrcv.c]
	-Changed chkproto() to better recognise whether it's dealing with a
	 <fnord>adel/STadel options command, or a Cit-86 ITL change command.
	 [netrcv.c]
	-Added a new feature to dumpmsg.tos, the ability to specify a command
	 line parameter x-y, which is interpreted as a command to dump
	 message file blocks x through y, inclusive.  [dumpmsg.c]

90Dec30  citadel 1.31-12
	-Added statroom() call to [M]ail command to dump Mail> message counts.
	 [ctdl.c]
	-Added hook to read1mesg() to properly abort a long sequence of "can't
	 find message" errors when user hits [S]top.  [msg.c]
	-Minor cosmetic hack to roomscan() to eliminate spurious ' '.  [cfg.c]
	-Cleaned up .R= a bit: properly output \r's in read1mesg(), after use
	 of [S]top.  [msg.c]
	-Fixed .R<number> so it doesn't show "(-1 left)" in header; hack put
	 in doRead() and read1mesg().  [doread.c,msg.c]
	-Removed "[^L]" prompt from after display of mainopt.mnu in
	 doRegular().  Added it to room prompt for non-expert Sysop users, in
	 givePrompt().  [ctdl.c,misc.c]

91Jan01  citadel 1.31-13
	-Fixed the rev_jul() function, and re-enabled its use.  [rev_jul.c,
	 clog.c, scanzt.c, citpeek.c]
	-Instituted high-bit-set scheme for marking received mail messages in
	 logBuf.lbmail.  Implemented markreceived().  Put definitions for
	 accessing the high bit into ctdl.h.  Did stuff. [ctdl.h, msg.c,
	 log.c, noteroom.c, printmsg.c]
	-Added support for C86 msg field 'S', as msgBuf.mbsrcid.  Passed along
	 through net functions and filled in by bodymesg() for locally-entered
	 messages.  [postmsg.c, netmisc.c, msg.c, ctdl.h, getspool.c, msgio2.c]
	-Also added support for C86 message field 'X', as msgBuf.mbdomain.
	 Currently passed along but not filled in for locally-entered messages.
	 [as above minus msg.c]
	-Added extra zap-loop debugging to notseen(), tied to +netdebug.
	 [zaploop.c]
	-GROSS HACK!  Added code to logscan() in configur to detect, via
	 some highly suspicious and dubious practices, whether msg pointers
	 in lbmail[] are of the old negated variety, and to abs() same. [cfg.c]
	-Also added code in logscan() to purge out lbmail msg pointers that
	 are outside the valid range of cfg.oldest..cfg.newest.  [cfg.c]

91Jan03  citadel 1.31-14
	-Improved the loopzapper by adding nodename, room-gen and last msgid
	 fields to the zaploop struct.  Also changed the date representation
	 to ANSI standard time_t.  Hacked notseen() to use id AND date
	 as criteria.  Modified scanzt and makezt accordingly; improved
	 scanzt's output format.  Minor mods to configur.  [zaploop.h,
	 zaploop.c, scanzt.c, makezt.c, cfg.c]
	-Fixed a bug in the handling of msgBuf.mbsrcid; decided to save the
	 field as it's transmitted (in hi-word/lo-word format) to save hassle.
	 [postmsg.c, getspool.c, msgio2.c]

91Jan05  citadel 1.31-15
	-Added three more special doors named "login", "logout" and "newuser",
	 doing the expected things.  [door.c, log.c, citadel.h]
	-Attempts made to shut up gcc about the various incompatible pointer
	 passing things. [cfg.h, citadel.h, libevent.c, archive.c, cfg.c,
	 doread.c, editor.c, misc.c, room.c, roomedit.c, logedit.c, popular.c]

91Jan07  citadel 1.31-16
	-Finally fixed the mbsrcid problems.  Hacks made to getspool(),
	 getmessage(), putspool(), putmessage(), wcprintmsg() or whatever it
	 is.  [getspool.c, msgio2.c, postmsg.c, netmisc.c]
	-Hack made to .R= driver to display mbsrcids.  [msg.c]
	-Fixed some more \r\r problems.  [doread.c, ctdl.c]
	-Fixed the I/O redirection problems in rundoor() by remembering the
	 differences between stdio routines and OS calls.  (stdio calls
	 changed to OS calls).  [door.c]
	-More smarts for makezt - ignores messages with spurious dates/ids.
	 [makezt.c]
	-Extra diagnostics (tied to netDebug) in notseen(). [zaploop.c]
	-Removed extra hangup()s in networking; also put in hooks to make
	 doResults() disable the modem while it's working. [netrcv.c]
	-Removed some debugging from writeformatted() now that we know why
	 it was failing. [misc.c]
	-Fixed a bug with dorestrict() causing it to compare with logBuf.
	 lbname when said field was empty.  Also fixed stupid question in
	 [S]witch - userlist_menu().  [log.c, dosysop.c]

91Jan12  citadel 1.31-17
	-Converted all remaining time/date functions to ANSI standards (i.e.
	 time_t instead of julian dates.)  Eliminated parsedate(), rev_jul()
	 and julian_date().  Moved day_of_week() to formtime.c, what with
	 juldate.c disappearing.  Changed logBuf.lblast from `long' to
	 `time_t'; this necessitated another ugly hack to configur to silently
	 convert old-style lblasts into new ones.  [ctdl.h, cfg.c, log.c,
	 scandir.c, etc.; Obsoleted rev_jul.c, juldate.c]
	-Invented makedate() to form time_t dates into citadel-format date
	 strings, and converted a few utilities to use it. [makedate.c,
	 citpeek.c, clog.c, scanzt.c]
	-Invented msgtime(), which takes a citadel-format date & time and
	 returns a time_t. [msgtime.c, zaploop.c, makezt.c, a few others]
	-Changed format of most `days' bitmaps from `xSSFRWTM' to `xSFRTWMS'.
	 This affects polling, events, and netBuf.poll_day; kept some old-
	 style code around to handle netBuf.poll_day until such time as we
	 write a conversion program for something more important.  Minor
	 hacks to showdays(). [libevent.c, misc.c, dosysop.c]
	-Enhanced .R[+-] -- you can now specify BOTH a `Before' and `After'
	 date.  Changes to dateok(), doRead(), getpdate(), etc.  Also, <CR>
	 causes date to default to date of last call. [misc.c, doread.c, msg.c,
	 dateread.h]
	-Since we were changing header files anyway, removed some crap.
	 [roomedit.c, citadel.h]
	-Fixed a cast to shut up the compiler. [dumpmsg.c]
	-Minor fix to door code: If the user is on the console it removes the
	 status bar, if present, before doing a door, and puts it back when
	 the door finishes. [sysdep.c]
	-The status bar wasn't being fully recreated after a door exited, so
	 a minor hack to makebar() was made. [statbar.c]

91Jan12  citadel 1.31-18
	-changed a couple of mprintf()s to iprintf()s in showskipped().
	 [room.c]

	[MiNT-libs bug with unstoppable output finally fixed.  Wow, is it
	 S-L-O-W....]

91Jan13  citadel 1.31-19
	-new .RM function [P]romote to take a local message to net message.
	 Hooks in displaymesg() and tailmesg(), plus new function _mutate().
	 NOTE: once we figure out how to do the awful arithmetic in
	 displaymesg(), we can make _mutate() delete the old message after
	 re-saving it as a net message.  [msg.c]
	-fixed up the setting of (msgBuf,mNETMESSAGE) in a couple of places.
	 [editor.c, msg.c]
	-prettified the sources and removed some setbuf() calls from some
	 utilities. [citfs.c, lchange.c, logedit.c, mchange.c, mexpand.c,
	 scanzt.c]

91Jan14  citadel 1.31-20
	-fixed [P]romote bug by forcing _mutate() to get the full message text.
	 [msg.c]
	-added a few more goodies to the .R= display (e.g. date & time, Cit-86
	 domain field, etc.) in read1mesg().  [msg.c]
	-made .R= usable only by SomeSysop(), in doRead() & doRegular().
	 [doread.c, ctdl.c]
	-implemented the user-configurable default transfer protocol in
	 doRead(), doEnter() and upload().  Setup is done in config(), which
	 calls new function getproto().  Viewing is done in showcfg().  Initial
	 setting done in newuserlogin().  [doread.c, doenter.c, misc.c, log.c]

91Jan15  citadel 1.31-21
	-Renamed the [P]romote command to [O] (whatever that means); added a
	 couple more checks to new function canpromote(). [msg.c]

91Jan19  citadel 1.31-22
	-Modified zap table update code to record date & source ID values from
	 incoming messages when either value (or both) causes a message to be
	 accepted.  Old code only recorded values that were higher than the
	 values last seen.  Also diddled the netDebug diagnostic messages.
	 In notseen().  [zaploop.c]

91Jan21  citadel 1.31-23
	-Fixed bug in configur: was calling makelock() before it knew where
	 #sysdir was.  [cfg.c]
	-Fixed bug with passwords echoing to the console (`echo' is either
	 YES or NO, not CALLER/BOTH).  [log.c]
	-loadnet no longer checks for duplicate node IDs.  [loadnet.c]
	-Modified .R= to be available to everyone, and just not print msg #s
	 for non-anonymous rooms.  [ctdl.c, doread.c, msg.c]

91Jan22  *** v1.31 beta distribution sent out ***

	[CONTINUED IN INCREM.3]
