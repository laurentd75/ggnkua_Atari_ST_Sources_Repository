Fnordadel is the aggregate work of many people.  Chief among these are
Cynbe ru Taren (CrT), who did the original Citadel for CP/M;
H.A. White (Hue, Jr.) of Minneapolis, who ported Citadel to MS/DOS and
created Citadel-86; and
David L. Parsons (orc), who ported Citadel-86 to the Atari ST and created
STadel.  We (Adrian
Ashley and Royce Howland) took STadel and hacked it to create Fnordadel; any
bugs and misfeatures should be assumed to be our fault alone, unless
you're planning to sue.

We would like to thank the following people for their help and input
into both Fnordadel and this manual:
John Edstrom, Hue, Jr., David Parsons (orc), David ``Wally'' Williscroft,
Garth Wood, Ken Badertscher (kbad @@ Virtuality) and many others.

Special thanks to Garth Wood, who contributed material for the first draft
of this manual; as with everything else we get, we've hacked it to bits, but
an original word or two probably still remains.  Also to kbad, who proofed
the first draft of the Texinfo version of this manual and provided critiques.
Look, Ken, no Dreaded Emoticons!  @smiley{}  @smiley{}  @smiley{}

Thanks also to the loyal users of secret and RT (our own boards), and our
many beta testers who suffered (and continue to suffer)
through buggy beta versions.  We appreciate your input.

Final thanks to the Coca-Cola company, without whose product (Coke Classic)
we probably would be richer but further behind.
