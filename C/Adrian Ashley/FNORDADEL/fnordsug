	Being a list of known suggestions for spiffing up Fnordadel

 89Dec01
	- [0] - [9] commands (to print text files on any given pathspec).
	- Ability to backspace in dot and floor commands.
	- Optional pre-format on uploaded messages (a la makemsg).
1.32-0	- New message flags: mIMPERVIOUS, mPREFORMATTED.

 90Jul31
	- Filters:  Lithp, Buht-wheat, "DETH", Japanese, Line noise.
	- On-the-fly LZH compression (network; message base; etc.)
	- Unify sys files as well for purge/restrict/twit maybe.
		<userid> [PURGE] [NET-PURGE] [NET-NODE-PURGE] [TWIT] [RESTRICT]
		When read into system, put into struct {LABEL name;
							long flags;
							struct x *next; }
	- .Z(forget) U(ser); have one master list of all forgotten aliases,
	  then each user has a list of indexes into the master list for the
	  ones they've actually .ZU'ed.
	- Do .U(nforget) U(ser); possibly .U(nforget) R(oom) as well (?).
	- Rework ^LU menu.
	- .RQ(uote); specify block start and end; quote text into Held buffer.
	  Use .RC(apture) code.
	- When .ER expires a room, generate an Aide message.
	- iChar() returns HUP for all CTRL characters; it shouldn't.
	- .R#x [NORA] - x is limit on # of messages to read; also: user
	  configurable default value for above.
	- rchange room shuffling code (see piece of paper).
 	- External utility to share many rooms with a node (see
	  loadnet); OR: have ^LNE allow sharing/unsharing of rooms.
	- Totally REWORK callstat, especially the bleedin' line mungin'.
1.32-38	- CTRL-<whatever> twit toggle from console while user online.
1.32-38	- CTRL-<whatever> Punt command/Fake error from console...
1.31-19	- new aide command to Promote a message from local to net (resaving
	  it, essentially, and deleting the first one.) (use Held buffer)
	  (Initial - resaves message, does not delete original.)

 90Aug12
	- Print option for TheSysop() (maybe in .RM)
	- Make 'punt' a modifier for .T(erminate), to enable .TPS.
	- Private/Invite-only room creator should get an automatic invite to
	  the room.

 90Oct23
	- Improve message caching for [R]everse; 4K buffer doesn't help.
	- .Z should list all rooms (Public, Private and Invite-only) for any
	  uSYSOP.
	- Make .S? show list of skipped rooms, a la .Z for [Z] rooms.
	- New message type: local-net.  Message sent only to local nodes;
	  needs some way to prevent msgs being backboned onward by recipients.
	  (Can we pervert/exploit mbroute?)
	- Make .[ER]B(inary-file) into .[ER]B(atch), defaulting to Ymodem.
1.32-?	- uSYSOPs should be able to .G(oto) PARTIALROOMNAME for private rooms
	  (and invite only rooms?)

 90Dec27
	- More smarts in configur to skip over message discontinuities such as
	  152722, 152723, 151036, 152726, 152727, ...
1.32-9	- canreply() should display error messages when refusing to allow
	  replies.

 91Feb09
	- Expand the functionality of logedit.tos.  Have it display all log
	  values (a la citpeek.tos), and permit editing them.
	- Fix on the regexp stuff in editor.c.

 91Feb21
	- Fix lFloor() so it takes l_FGT and does the right thing with it.
	- Make a utility to eat normal text files and spew out spool files.
	- Make a command somewhere in Fnordadel to iNgEsT spool files from
	  other places besides *.dis in #netdir.
	- Amalgamate macro netPending() in netmisc.c with needtocall() in
	  netmain.c.
1.32-3	- Put date printouts on all the time stamps in netlog.sys.

 91Feb27
	- Implement user-configurable page display mode a la STadel.
	- Implement user- and Sysop-configurable subject fields a la STadel.
	- Implement some sort of warning to tell users entering net messages
	  when they are approaching the 7500-character limit.
	- When mailing reject notices to people about undelivered net mail,
	  quote the original message.
1.32-6	- Make Fnordadel work as a door.  [Partly done.  Currently should
	  work as a door from any program except another STadel/Fnordadel,
	  since citadel.tos chains to the destination directory, then writes
	  out ctdltabl.sys, clobbering the one that was there for the door
	  copy of citadel.tos.]

 91Mar09
	- Batch sequential net messages from one user into one message.
1.32-7	- When [G]oto/[S]kip has no rooms left with new messages, print some
	  kind of message to that effect for non-experts.
1.32-29	- Add Sysop configurable user config defaults.

 91Mar16
	- Figure out some way(s) to speed up room access.
	- Cit-86-style "mail forwarding", i.e. send a user's mail from the
	  system of receipt to another system, defined by the user.
	- Room moderator privs.
	- Check connect time when returning from doors to catch door hogs.
	- Compact room info into one file?
1.32-9	- At mid-night when resetting user limit values, don't set to 0; just
	  subtract daily max from them so that overages roll to following days.
1.32-9	- Allow console users to run doors without logging in.
1.32-15	- Show first-time callers 10 newest msgs/room instead of 50 newest
	  msgs on the system.  Make the '10' configurable in ctdlcnfg.sys.
	  (Possibly temporary compromise: still show N newest, but N is set in
	  ctdlcnfg.sys; if 0, show all new messages.)

 91Mar21
	- Implement user groups for invite/evict, mail, room readable/writable.
	- When incoming net-mail gets rejected, spool it & allow integration
	  in ^LND.
	- Implement auto-run room-bound doors.  Run on entry or exit.  (?)
1.32-10	- Stop showing newly-entered messages at the tail end of .RM.
1.32-29	- Alter .RE to put the time/date stamp before the description.
1.32-38	- Status line flag for chat requested.  (Or on user name if status
	  line not used.)
1.32-15	- Convert use of max() to MAX(), #define'd in ctdl.h.  Add MIN() &
	  remove from netmain.c.
1.32-15	- Don't put sequential goto's to the same room each on the backup
	  stack.
1.32-29	- Reimplement .B(ackup)/.U(ngoto) ROOMNAME.  But why??????

 91Apr01
	- Get rid of gotos in tailmesg().
1.32-15	- Implement MAXMAILMSGS so Mail> can be configured separately from
	  public rooms.
 
 91Apr28
1.32-31	- Implement Hue, Jr.'s "checkpoint" in configur while scanning
	  message base.
1.32-26	- Implement a .R option to override the "more" default, if set.
	  (Possibly treat [M] itself as a toggle switch.)
1.32-29	- Implement actual prompts for .R[FDE], for non-experts.
1.32-29	- Remove ugly hacks from configur.tos.
1.32-31	- Integrate 'scribe' into the fnord generator, or at least make the
	  fnords unlimited in number. [Done the latter.]

 91May02
	- Somehow make message copying into net rooms work so that the message
	  will be netted out.
	- Make .RU accept multiple user-names.
	- Make .RU match on node name as well, e.g. .RU "foo@bar" or
	  .RU "@bar".
1.32-26	- Make a Sysop-settable flag to switch the midnight user limit reset
	  to zeroing the limits instead of decrementing by the daily limit.
1.32-26	- Implement a negation flag for .R, e.g. .R(ead) ~(not) I(nvited).
	  Short-term (if desired): negation flag applies to all modifiers.
	  Long-term: negation flag applies only to following modifier.

 91May05
	- Run stored spool files through crypte() to hide them.
1.32-26	- Check for close events before letting users into doors.
1.32-26	- Implement door privs a la net & mail privs.
1.32-26	- Print "Outside commands" or some-such when Sysop does ^LO, so a
	  remote user will know what's going on while waiting.
1.32-26	- Put in a ctdlcnfg.sys parameter to do auto-new message display in
	  Lobby> when user signs on.

 91May27
	- Do away with 10,000 char message limit (make it dynamic).
	- Make netmap prettier when handling aliased rooms.
1.32-40	- Change message # reading code to be command driven (e.g. [#] and
	  .R#), causing a prompt "Enter # of message to read: ".
1.32-29	- Finish off door privs stuff (add to [V]iew user, clog.tos, vlog.tos).

 91Jun05
	- Convert 'more' [S]top to [S]kip, esp. for use in .RMG (kbad).
	- Don't show no-op room edits in Aide>.
	- Make it so that remotesysops don't get into rooms they've
	  forgotten after using ^L.
	- Make user logBuf record precisely* which msgs are new in each room;
	  need 4 * (# of rooms) bytes used in long newmsgs[cfg.maxrooms].  Add
	  new user config variable to use old or new [G]oto style.  Modify
	  rchange.  Add [J]unk command for people using new [G]oto; wipes all
	  new messages in room.
	- New ctdlcnfg.sys parameter #vapordir.  If "", no effect.  If not "",
	  points to a directory in which to store journalled copies of all
	  messages vaporized using #vaporize.
1.32-40	- New purge mode "vaporize": #define vaporize [0 | 1] in ctdlcnfg.sys.
1.32-41	  If 0, no changes.  If 1, makes local msg purge routine "roll back"
	  purgable msgs by reseting cfg.newest, cfg.catChar & cfg.catSector to
	  their values at user's time of login.  Must also overwrite all
	  messages generated during user's call with 0x00.  Generate Aide> msg.
1.32-40	- Make autoshownew user-settable, not just system-wide.
1.32-40	- When aliased rooms generate Aide> messages, show local room name as
	  well as remote alias name.

 91Jun30
	- Make ;G unforget floors like .G unforgets rooms.
	- Display error when disk full (e.g. during write of calllog.sys or
	  netlog.sys; also ctdltabl.sys).
	- Make .EH query "Move to original room of entry?" when used on a held
	  message from a previous login session.
1.32-40	- Expand the file browser:  [B]ackup; [H]eader; [U]nmark.
1.32-38	- Generate Aide> message for net file-xfers (did it work, or what?).
1.32-38	- Put room name in "entry cmd:" prompt.
1.32-38	- Describe room in [I]nfo blurb: This room is anonymous, shared,
	  auto-net, directory, private, etc.
1.32-38	- Pass through STadel subject fields.
1.32-38	- Add message time to scanzt display.
1.32-38	- Make "Enter room info?" question Sysop-configurable for use by all
	  users creating rooms.
1.32-38	- Let doors be bound to any room type, not just directory rooms.

	  users not logged in (e.g. when system is closed).
1.32-38	- Append "from user @ node" to "Delivering mail to user" in netlog.sys.

 91Jul25
	- Run doors from menus.  (e.g. "%!Foo The game of foo".)
1.32-38	- Rotating banners.

 91Aug07
	- Split ctdltabl.sys into two parts: the more static info vs. the
	  frequently changed info.  (I.e. static/changed wrt code changes.)
	- Duplicate all citadel.tos command-line options in ctdlcnfg.sys;
	  eliminate some of the command-line versions; invert some of the
	  switches (e.g. status line, ymodem).
	- New network command to request a listing of a directory room.
1.32-44	- Show total file size in browser [V]iew.  (And transfer time?)
1.32-51	- New door mode that doesn't chain to a room's directory, as normally
	  would happen.  (Use for citadel utilities that need to find
	  ctdltabs.sys in the home directory.)

 91Aug13
	- Integrate purge & restrict user lists with new Z User database.
	- Make message header display IMPERVIOUS in editor.
	- Add something to the dialer to call all local systems.  &L ?
	- Add some kind of CD delay for modems that generate bogus CD after a
	  reset, busy signal, etc.
1.32-47	- Add a ctdlcnfg.sys parameter to control size of room info files.
1.32-49	- Update status line differently for logout doors (e.g. cookie).  The
	  "logout: user @ time" message seems to get overwritten.

 91Aug19
	- Fix loop zapper so that if a looped message comes in the same session
	  as the original, the duplicate gets zapped.
	- Add "(CR=<date>)" to .R+- prompt, to show default date of last login.
	- Make ckdoor a true utility: load ctdltabl.sys to find ctdldoor.sys,
	  and process 'i' parameter by looking for room name.
	- Add a net node comment field (for Sysop name, etc.).

 91Aug30
	- Make the rsconf() call set 8N1.
	- Make all users login in Lobby> (to prevent access to hidden rooms
	  via .TS).
	- Let [T] and [Z] dialers take node names from the zap database.

 91Sep02  (Sugs merged in from a separate list)
	- Multiple mail.
	- Mail to multiple net nodes. In particular, reimplement &L (local
	  net). Also do &N (l-d net), &A (all nets) and &# (all nodes on net #).
 	- External utility to share many rooms with a node (see
	  loadnet); OR: have ^LNE allow sharing/unsharing of rooms.
	- Have Mail> reply check for net aliases.
	- Substring matching of entered nodenames (in all situations)
