91Jan23  citadel 1.31-24
  Jan24	-Added mAbort() call in read1mesg() to allow long unsuccessful
  Jan26	 message scans to be aborted.  [msg.c]
	-Added file browser under .RM[DE].  Not yet enabled due to a couple
	 of design things that need to be worked out...  [doread.c]
	-Refined browser and added download parts.  [doread.c]
	-Added browser cleanup call to exitCitadel().  [misc.c]
	-Fixed a \r\r problem in readdir().  [doread.c]
	-Added "#ifndef _FOO_H..." protection lines to header files.  [cith\*]
	-Added support for user-definable archivers under .R(ead) H(eader).
	 New lines in ctdlcnfg.sys of the form "#archiver EXT doorname".
	 New cfg member arch_count, and global array of structs holding
	 archiver info called archTab[].  arctoc() now checks the archivers
	 list first, then checks to see if the file ends in .arc (and if so,
	 invokes the old .arc reading code), then gives up.  initdoor() now
	 scans the archiver list matching doors to archiver names.  [cfg.c,
	 ctdl.h, archivers.h, door.c, doread.c, readtabl.c, writetbl.c]
	-Fixed problem with ugly userlog hack in configur, by adding another
	 (temporary) ugly hack.  [cfg.c]

91Jan27  citadel 1.31-25
	-Fixed problem in editText() and putmessage() causing anon. messages
	 to get the wrong header info set up & saved.  [editor.c,postmsg.c]

91Jan28  citadel 1.31-26
	-Fixed terminate() to output the logout bits to calllog.sys when a user
	 gets punted by dorestrict().  [log.c]
	-Initialize local variable floorsave to 0 in doKnown(), in an attempt
	 to eliminate a mysterious musical floor mode bug.  Also made the
	 current floor a permanent part of the givePrompt() display as temp.
	 debugging in case the floorsave change doesn't fix things.  [ctdl.c,
	 misc.c]
	-Refixed anonymous message problem fixed in 1.31-25, by removing mods
	 put in for 1.31-25 and modifying createmesg() to set the mANONMESSAGE
	 flag for message entry in anonymous rooms.  [editor.c,postmsg.c,msg.c]
	-Yet another change to outspaces() to try to clean up the formatter
	 once and for all.  [format.c]
	-Glommed some regexp stuff into the editor to start playing around.
	 It doesn't work properly.  [editor.c]

91Feb02  citadel 1.31-27
	-Fixed donetpurge() so it uses strnicmp() instead of whereis() to
	 check message author against the purge list.  [netrcv.c]

91Feb04  citadel 1.31-28
	-Fixed mindbogglingly stupid bug in getpdate() causing it not to work
	 at all, really.  [doread.c]
	-Mark incoming net messages with mNETMESSAGE flag, in doNetRooms().
	 [netrcv.c]
	-Fixed anonymous message crap:  putheader() now works right; editText
	 doesn't go nuking msgBuf.mbauth anymore; putmessage() hacked a bit
	 for networked anon. messages; createmesg() and read1mesg() made
	 ignorant of anon messages. [msg.c, printmsg.c, editor.c, postmsg.c]
	-.ER no longer nukes empty shared rooms.  In indexRooms().  [room.c]
	-Added sanity check for unparsable dates in notseen().  [zaploop.c]
	-Putmessage() clears anon flag if !anon room; putheader() has an
	 additional sanity check on msg AND room anon flags before printing
	 anon-format header.  [printmsg.c, postmsg.c]

#
# Version 1.32
#

91Feb06  citadel 1.32-0
	-Fixed candelete(), which was using msgBuf flag mMAILRECEIVED, a flag
	 we did away with earlier.  [msg.c]
	-Began addition of new security measures maxcalls, maxtime, and
	 maxclosecalls.  [ctdl.h]
	-Created utility to convert log file, conv32.tos.  [conv32.c, conv32.h]
	-Added some new flags since everything needed to be recompiled anyway:
	 message flags mIMPERVIOUS & mPREFORMATTED; user flag uMAILPRIV;
	 cfg flags AIDEKILLROOM, ANONNETMAIL, & ANONFILEXFER.  [flags.h]
	-Added another new logBuf parameter, lbreadnum, on which .R<#> will be
	 based (read # of messages, NORA).  [ctdl.h]
	-Implemented the new cfg parameters and flags in setvariable().  [cfg.c]
	-Updated citpeek.tos to display the new cfg & logBuf stuff.  [citpeek.c]
	-Added new terminate() flags tMAXCALLS == 'c', tMAXTIME == 'T', and
	 tMAXCLOSECALLS == 'C'.  [terminat.h]
	-Added new logBuf stuff to vlog.tos.  [vlog.c]
	-Eliminated goto crap from doEnter().  Also changed read-only check to
	 allow Aides to enter messages as well as Sysops.  [doenter.c]
	-Added code to handle user flag uMAILPRIV to newuserlogin(), setlog(),
	 viewuser(), dostatus(), mailtoggle() (new function), doEnter().
	 [log.c, dosysop.c, doenter.c]
	-Added code to handle the new login limits in login() & terminate().
	 [log.c]
	-Removed lbwidth from clog.tos output, added uMAILPRIV.  [clog.c]
	-Added code to check cfg flag AIDEKILLROOM in doAide() and killFloor().
	 [ctdl.c, floor.c]
	-Added new function resetlimits() and code to dostatus() to permit
	 Sysop to manually reset a user's daily limit logBuf values.  Display
	 these values in viewuser().  [dosysop.c]
	-Moved changepw() from log.c to doenter.c and made static.  Split log.c
	 into login.c (login-related stuff plus setLog()) and terminat.c
	 (terminate-related stuff).  Hacked citadel.h and makefile as needed.
	 Eliminated function initprevuser() in log.c; moved contents to ctdl.c.
	 [log.c, login.c, terminat.c, doenter.c, citadel.h, makefile, ctdl.c]
	-Changed terminate() slightly so it updates lblast to user logout time
	 and then does a putLog().  This is to more accurately indentify close
	 calls.  [terminat.c]
	-Added parameter enterifZ to canEnter().  If YES, allows room entry for
	 public forgotten rooms.  If NO, it doesn't.  Changed all instances of
	 canEnter() to have the (hopefully) appropriate enterifZ value.  Had to
	 add a similar parameter to pickRooms(), which calls canEnter().
	 [msg.c, floor.c, room.c, citadel.h]

91Feb20  citadel 1.32-1
	-Fixed makedate() to avoid using NULL pointers returned by localtime().
	 [makedate.c]
	-Exempted console users from maxcalls, maxtime and maxclosecalls in
	 login().  [login.c]
	-Removed a bit of floor debugging in givePrompt() stuck in with
	 1.31-26.  [misc.c]
	-Fixed incorrect call of canEnter(...,YES) to canEnter(...,NO) in
	 partialExist().  [room.c]
	-Made postmail() set the msgBuf mNETMESSAGE flag for incoming net mail
	 delivered to users at this node.  [postmsg.c]
	-Made chkaddress() also set the msgBuf mNETMESSAGE flag for locally-
	 entered net mail.  [msg.c]
	-Fixed cosmetic bug in tailmesg().  [msg.c]
	-Fixed chkaddress() to prevent entry of mail to oneself.  [msg.c]
	-Fixed modIn() so it won't punt the Sysop to do an anytime net.
	 [modem.c]
	-Hacked on donetpurge() to improve its discrimination, esp. re author
	 fields like "somebody@somewhere".  [netrcv.c]
	-Fixed addressee() to replace "user @node" with "user@node".  [msg.c]

91Feb21  citadel 1.32-2
	-Fixed null-ptr deref in donetpurge().  [netrcv.c]
	-Made configur explicitly nuke all codeBuf[] offsets when it's using
	 an old ctdltabl.sys, just in case something that was defined in
	 ctdlcnfg.sys has now become undefined.  [cfg.c]
	-Added some smarts (hopefully) to getmsg() in configur.  [cfg.c]
	-Dumpmsg now takes last argument to be cryptSeed if it can't read
	 ctdltabl.sys.  [dumpmsg.c]
	-Upgraded doForget() to print forgotten rooms on all floors if in
	 floor mode.  [ctdl.c]
	-Added return value to deletemail(); copymessage() now bails out if
	 deletemail() fails.  Also fixed candelete() to disallow deletion of
	 Mail not entered by the user (for ANY user).  [msg.c]

91Feb22  citadel 1.32-3
	-Added the [I]nfo command.  Text stored as a spool file (via _spool()
	 and getspool() for writing and reading, respectively) as
	 `#roomdir\roomXXXX.inf'.  Put [I] hooks in doRegular().  New function
	 doInfo() to read and print a room description.  .ER now asks for
	 a description.  Hacks to getText() and editText() to take an extra
	 parameter (eMESSAGE or eINFO).  editroom() now has two more options,
	 `[L]- enter room description' and `[K]ill room description'.  Hacks
	 to indexRooms() and the [K]ill room function (in doAide()) to
	 remove old info files when nuking rooms.  New roomBuf flag called
	 `DESCRIPTION' to keep tabs on which rooms have descriptions.  New
	 header file `editor.h' for a couple of defs needed in a few places.
	 [ctdl.c, editor.c, msg.c, room.c, roomedit.c, flags.h, citadel.h,
	  editor.h]
	-Fixed a couple of annoyances in the net logging - made it print
	 time AND date in all cases.  [netmain.c]
	-#ifdef'ed out the regexp stuff in the editor.  [editor.c]
	-Removed all references to global file variable 'spool'; converted to
	 local function variables called 'spl', everywhere except xymodem.c,
	 where a static declaration was used.  [ctdl.c, holdmsg.c, netcall.c,
	 netmain.c, postmsg.c, room.c, roomedit.c, xymodem.c]
	-Generalised the getspool() and getstrspool() functions to take a
	 spool-file parameter instead of using the old global spool.  [ctdl.c,
	 holdmsg.c, netcall.c, netmain.c, netrcv.c, roomedit.c, getspool.c,
	 citlib.h]
	-Implemented cfg.PURGENET flag to control use of net purge code.  If
	 +purge not used, no purges (net or otherwise).	 [cfg.c, flags.h]
	-Implemented discard files in #netdir.  Whenever a message is zapped or
	 purged in doNetRooms(), it can be optionally (cfg.KEEPDISCARDS) copied
	 into a file 'XXXXXXXX.dis', where 'XXXXXXXX' is the hex time_t value
	 of the date & time of the discard file creation.  [netrcv.c, cfg.c,
	 flags.h]
	-Implemented new net menu command, [D]iscard.  Loops through *.dis
	 files in #netdir, allowing Sysop to "[A]gain, [D]elete, [I]ntegrate,
	 [N]ext, [S]top" on them.  New function dodiscard() is the guts.  When
	 integrating a (net) message into its original (net) room, the routing
	 info will be just as if the message had not been zapped.  I.e., all
	 backboning, etc. considerations will be in force.
	 [netmisc.c]
