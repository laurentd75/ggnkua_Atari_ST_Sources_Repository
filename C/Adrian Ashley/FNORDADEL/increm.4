	 [log.h, config.h, cfg.c, dosysop.c, door.c]
	-New ctdlcnfg.sys parameter "eventclosetime" -- defines how close an
	 event must be pending before time-consuming commands are disallowed.
	 Code in cfg to handle it; new function event_pending() in libevent
	 to return YES if such a close event is pending and optionally print a
	 helpful message.  Called in dodoor(), but we could add calls in other
	 places.  [config.h, cfg.c, door.c, libevent.c]
	-New .R parameter '~' to negate the next command; works with More,
	 Local-only, User and Invited.  Hacks to doRead() and legitimate().

	 showMessages() to doRead(). [msg.c, doread.c]
	-Put in logic for .R~I in doRead(). (oops.)  [doread.c]

91May31 v1.32-29	citadel.tos
	-viewuser() now displays door privs, if present.  [dosysop.c]

	-Added "enter file name" prompt to .R[DEF] in doRead(), for non-
	 experts.  [doread.c]
	-.B/.U code restored in ungoto().  On close examination, orc's code
	 seems okay.  Did we fix it then disable it, or was it always okay, or
	 am I not seeing the problem in it?  [ctdl.c]
	-Put file date before description in printdir().  [doread.c]
	-Added Sysop configurable user defaults for uSHOWTIME, uLASTOLD,
	 uFLOORMODE, uREADMORE, and uNUMLEFT; set in newuserlogin().  The
	 ctdlcnfg.sys variables are DEFSHOWTIME, DEFLASTOLD, DEFFLOORMODE,
	 DEFREADMORE, and DEFNUMLEFT, in setvariable().  [login.c, cfg.c]

	-Dynamicised the loading of <fnord>s so there's no longer a limit of
	 20. [ctdl.c]

	 writing a file to #sysdir (checkpt.sys) containing cfg.newest,
	 cfg.catSector and cfg.catChar, each time we save a new message.
	 If you invoke configur with the "-c" flag, it uses
	 the checkpoint file when scanning the message base.  Changes to
	 msgscan() in cfg, new file citlib/checkpt.c, and change to
	 notemessage(). [cfg.c, postmsg.c, checkpt.c, makefile]

	-Same for .EF and Upload commands. [doenter.c]
	-Redid the help system. Now several entry points: hothelp(), for
	 menu-style hot helps; help() for plain old dump-'em style helps;
	 menu() for .mnu files, and blurb() for .blb files.  All use the same
	 base function to print things, so '%' lines are filtered when not
	 needed for menus, etc.  Removed old functions tutorial() and
	 dotutorial().  [misc.c, hothelp.c, citadel.h, lots of other places.]

91Jun24	v1.32-35	citadel

	-Added confirmation prompts to delete/move/copy code in
	 copymessage(). [msg.c]
	-Changed name of directory room tagfile to "_fnord_.dir" to avoid
	 conflict with gcc UNIXMODE '.dir' files (for those of us who even
	 know about such things.)  [libtag.c]

91Jul01 v1.32-36	flipbits
	-Don't mess with Aide or Sysop accounts in flipbits.tos.  [flipbits.c]

91Jul08 v1.32-37	citadel.tos

	 puts a "TWIT" message after user's name in givePrompt().  [statbar.c,
	 misc.c]
	-Added global flag chatrequest; set in doChat() and ringSysop().
	 Puts a '*' on status line in stat_upd() when user has an
	 unanswered chat request outstanding.  If no status line, puts
	 a "chat requested" message after user's name in givePrompt().
	 Clear flag in terminate(), doChat() and ringSysop().  [citadel.h,
	 statbar.c, misc.c, ctdl.c, modem.c]
91Aug03 -Implemented ^E fake error in modIn().  Spits out contents of
	 fakeerr.blb, or if no such file, says "Whoops! Think I'll die now...".
	 Sets sysRequest, and punts user using terminate(YES, tPUNT).
	 [modem.c]
	-Added cfg flag INFOOK to control room info creation in makeRoom().
	 If 1, anybody can create room info; if 0, only Aides & Sysops can.
	 [config.h, cfg.c, room.c]
	-Added rotating banners.  New cfg parameter numbanners.  If 0, just
	 use normal banner.blb file; otherwise, use files banner.1, banner.2,
	 ... .  Second new cfg parameter, bannerblb.  If 1, display banner.blb
	 after rotating banner; if 0, don't.  Banner logic in greeting().  New
	 routine dobanner().  [citadel.h, config.h, cfg.c, ctdl.c, hothelp.c]

	 return from printdir() only if in singleMsg mode.  [doread.c, misc.c]
	-Added some more Aide> diagnostics for room share failures in
	 sendSharedRooms() and catchroom(); tied to netDebug.  Also changed
	 catchroom() room share errors sent to remote system, so room is
	 referred to by that system's name, not a local alias.  [netcall.c,
	 netrcv.c]
	-Removed ctdlcnfg.sys parameter AUTOSHOWNEW, added DEFAUTONEW and user
	 flag uAUTONEW.  Check uAUTONEW in login(); set it up in
