90Jul27  citadel 1.30-8
	-removed a lot of comments
	-changed definition of killroomBuf() to check for NULL ptr before
	 doing free(). [ctdl.h]
	-rewrote roomsanity() but did not enable it yet. [libroom.c]
	-added two onLine() checks in login() to fix login-loop bug. [log.c]

90Jul29  citadel 1.30-9
	-added to nfs_process(): clear FILEPENDING if no .nfs file. [nfs.c]
	-PATCHNUM split off from version.c so we can avoid relinking the whole
	 distribution every time we add \n to a string somewhere. [patchnum.c]

90Jul31  citadel 1.30-10
	-enabled rewritten roomsanity() from 1.30-8. [libroom.c]

90Jul31  citadel 1.30-11
	-fixed bug permitting entry of a new net node with a name that is
	 in use by another node. [netmisc.c]
	-fixed bug preventing the archiving of outgoing Sysop net mail by
	 nuking aNoteLogMessage() and subsuming its archive code into
	 notemessage(). [postmsg.c]
	-fixed bug in notemessage() whereby mail to Citadel would be saved
	 twice in author's logBuf. [postmsg.c]

90Aug03  citadel 1.30-12
	-disallow copying/moving of messages to Mail> in copymessage() [msg.c]
	-roomsIshare() now flags rooms with pending msgs with '*'. [netmisc.c]
	-fixed addNetNode() to disallow new nodes with nodeIDs that hash to
	 the same value as existing nodes. [netmisc.c]
	-fixed prtHdr() to withhold "Rec'd" printing for messages to "Citadel"
	 [libmsg.c]

	-added menu mode to citpeek [citpeek.c]
	-filled in showconfig() in citpeek [citpeek.c]

90Aug03  citadel 1.30-13 (hacks by RH)
	-added stripnl() and hacked getText() for held messages, stripping
	 trailing \n's from stuff [F]ile-grabbed or uploaded, so that <BS>
	 after .EH does the expected thing. [roomb.c]
	-added additional smarts to heldMessage() and procmessage() so that
	 .EH in Mail> to an unknown userID doesn't toast the held buffer.
	 [msg.c]
	-eliminated PATCHNUM in uucall [uucall.c]
	-cosmetic change to closeNet() [netmain.c]
	-commented out that portion of code in mAbort() responsible for
	 doing [D]/[J] after [P]. [msg.c]

90Aug04  citadel 1.30-14 (hacks by RH)
	-redefined TheSysop() and SomeSysop() to reflect new use of uSYSOP.
	 [ctdl.h]
	-minor hacks to doinherit() and dorestrict() to check existence of
	 cfg.sysopName before attempting to reference it. [log.c]
	-newuserlogin() now assigns uSYSOP, uAIDE and uNETPRIVS privs to
	 defined #sysop. [log.c]
	-added check for validity of cfg.sysopName before attempting to use
	 it, in notemessage(). [postmsg.c]
	-in aidetoggle(): nuke uSYSOP status if uAIDE toggled off; also ensure
	 that users given Aide privs are invited to Aide>. [dosysop.c]
	-added sysoptoggle(); modified twittoggle() to take uSYSOP into
	 account; added hooks in dostatus() for Sysop bit. [dosysop.c]
	-nuked some #ifdef'd stuff in renameRoom(). [roomedit.c]
	-additional test for delete permission in promptmsg(). [msg.c]

	-updated clog to print out status of uSYSOP. [clog.c]
	-updated vlog for uSYSOP as well. [vlog.c]

90Aug08  citadel 1.30-15 (hacks by AA)
	-changed SomeSysop() to TheSysop() in canEnter() to prevent the
	 automatic rediscovering of forgotten rooms by a uSYSOP calling in
	 from remote. [rooma.c]

90Aug12  citadel 1.30-16
	-fixed a broken stricmp() in readNegMail() which prevented any
	 notification to netmail authors of failed mail delivery. [netcall.c]
	-notemessage() now properly sysop-mail-archives mail to "Citadel",
	 meaning that sysop-mail-archiving now does everything that we think
	 it ought to. [postmsg.c]
	-added precautionary memset() to newuserlogin() to set the lbmail
	 array to all 0's. [log.c]
	-.R<protocol><CR> now produces a whazzit(); changed default value of
	 'reading' to ERROR and checked for same before any reading is done.
	 Also eliminated a goto, which is a tool of the debbil.  In doRead().
	 [doread.c]
	-code to do [D]elete and [J]ournal after a [P]ause re-enabled in
	 mAbort(). [msg.c]
	-commented out "A private room" stuff in makeRoom(). [roomb.c]
	-commented out "A private room" stuff (TWICE!) in renameRoom().
	 [roomedit.c]

	-added duplicate nodeID check to loadnet. [loadnet.c]

90Aug13  citadel 1.30-17
	-fixed IMPERVIOUS bug with .RMR and held msgs in editText(). [roomb.c]
	-added code to setmodem() to allow buffer to empty before resizing
	 the buffer; to fix bug observed with clog as a door. [driver.c]

90Aug14  citadel 1.30-18
	-fixed nulls bug in doCR() by putting a cast in. [libout.c]
	-moved declaration of netDebug from netrcv.c to netmain.c; ensured
	 that it was a char everywhere. [netmain.c, netrcv.c]

90Aug15  citadel 1.30-19
	-did some sanity checks and fixes on type matches for calls to
	 _printf(); fixed a bunch of possible bugs -- let's hope that the
	 junk-into-banner bug is one of them. [postmsg.c, sysdep.c, libdep.c]

90Aug19  citadel 1.30-20
	-junk-into-banner WASN'T one of them -- but THIS time... Fixed bug
	 in closeNet() whereby FILE *netLog was getting closed but not reset
	 to NULL -- splitF() checks for NULL to decide whether to write to the
	 logfile or not.  [netmain.c]

90Aug20  citadel 1.30-21
	-When MWC extended argument passing scheme was in use, doors wouldn't
	 get their arguments correctly; the environment was also not being
	 passed in.  Changed dosexec() to use the library function execve()
	 instead of a straight Pexec(), which necessitated some arg-parsing
	 code. [sysdep.c]

90Aug21  citadel 1.30-22
	-Implemented Citadel-86 version of OPTIONS command, called it
	 C86ITLCHG.  Added hooks in slavemode() and chkproto() to accept
	 command from Cit-86, and hooks in caller() to request it (dependent
	 on setting of CIT68 bit, of course).  Uses only YMODEM for now.
	 ( NOTE: disabled after test... ).  [ctdlnet.h, netcall.c, netrcv.c]

90Aug22  citadel 1.30-23
	-Major consistency check and overhaul.  All global functions and vars
	 declared anywhere in citlib\*.c made extern in new header `citlib.h'
	 which now gets #included by ctdl.h.  Thousands of redundant extern
	 decl's removed from citmain\*.c.  All function declarations checked
	 for proper return value.  [citmain\*.c, citlib\*.c (pretty much)]
	-initpurge() and initrestrict() combined into inituserlist(). [ctdl.c]
	-Similar checking to above done on citutil\*.c, except for callstat
	 (which is a lost cause.)  [citutil\*.c]
90Aug27-29
	-borrowed sprintf() and fprintf() from dLibs so we can avoid linking in
	 the MWC {fs}printf() functions -- we already have most of dLibs
	 printf() linked in.  Put these plus old strfunc.c into new library
	 'libfnord.a'.  [makefile, {fs}printf.c]
	-went totally overboard and library-ised damn near the whole \citlib
	 directory.  massive changes to the makefile (it's orders of
	 magnitude simpler everywhere except the place where the library is
	 built).  Left libarch, libevent, libfloor, libroute and libtag as
	 separate 'lib' files; everything else split into tiny pieces and
	 mashed into libfnord.a. [makefile, citlib\*]
	-redid citlib.h by running mkptypes on citlib\*.c, and by scouring
	 said files for global variables.  dependencies for \citlib files
	 redone in makefile.  crashout.c, io.s, getdiren.c and version.c
	 moved to \citlib. [<lots and lots o' files>]
	-Newcfg is now the default configur; old one moved to \citalt.
	-Ran mkptypes on citmain\*.c and called it `citadel.h', which is now
	 #included by citmain\*.c (except cfg.c).  All redundant extern
	 decl's removed from citmain\*.c, and things generally cleaned up.
	 [makefile, citmain\*.c, cith\citadel.h]

	[ That's enough for one patchnum... -aa ]

90Aug30  citadel 1.30-24
	-changed `SomeSysop' to `TheSysop' in roomCheck() in another attempt
	 to prevent uSYSOPs from being taken to all of their forgotten rooms
	 when they call in from remote.  [rooma.c]

90Aug31  citadel 1.30-25
	-fixed newly-introduced bug in neterror().  (Why didn't the fprintf()
	 call work?  I dunno...)  [neterror.c]
	-added writeSysTab() call to citfs -- now it will save the new
	 FILEPENDING status properly.  [citfs.c]
	-added support for incoming FILE_REQUEST commands from C86es:  Added
	 hook in slavemode() to receive FILE_REQUEST (`3') command; new
	 parameter to flingfile(); code in flingfile() to do the file sends and
	 send the terminating null header; and new sub-function `c86filereq()'
	 to handle each file.  CIT86 bit in netBuf is NOT checked; this means
	 that if Hue decides to implement proper YMODEM batch file requests,
	 we'll be ready for him.  [netrcv.c]
	-also added support for outgoing C86-style FILE_REQUESTs: some fairly
	 gross-looking code in nf_request().  Distinction between methods is
	 made at networking time by checking (netBuf,CIT86).  [nfs.c]

90Sep05  citadel 1.30-26
	-enabled NEWOPTS stuff (C86-style ITLCHG command); YMODEM seems to
	 work in all cases except after role-reversal when calling a C86.
	-added [F]orce-poll command to net menu in netStuff(), and even
	 updated the .mnu file!  [netmisc.c, netopt.mnu, makefile]
	-added line to [K]ill net node code to reset hash values.  [netmisc.c]
	-further refinements to nf_request() -- it still doesn't work right
	 with C86es, but at least it doesn't hang the machine anymore.  [nfs.c]
	-persuant to above, fixed recXfile() to correctly recognise error
	 status returned by (put *)() functions.  [xymodem.c]

90Sep10  citadel 1.30-27
	-some rather obvious bugs finally noticed in nf_request(), resulting
	 in the thing working properly now. [nfs.c]
	-more experimentation with recXfile(); still don't understand why
	 "return fputc(c,f) != EOF" in sendARchar() doesn't seem to ever
	 return '0', but DOES seem to return ERROR.  The last hack in -26
	 caused error condition from increment() to be recognised properly,
	 but also caused sendfiles from C86 to suddenly begin to fail.  Tres
	 weird.  [xymodem.c]
	-fixed bug in inituserlist() which was causing purging & restricting
	 to silently fail.  "Try returning the head of the list, idiot..."
	 [ctdl.c]

90Sep11  citadel 1.30-28
	-added SINGLE_FILE_REQUEST (#2) command upon discovering that C86
	 actually goes to the trouble of using it.  [netrcv.c, ctdlnet.h]
	-Removed definition of REMOTE_CMD (#10) and replaced with COMPACTION,
	 which is what C86 thinks command #10 means.  Luckily REMOTE_CMD
	 wasn't used yet.  (And neither is COMPACTION... yet.)

90Sep26  citadel 1.30-29
	-re-re-re-fixed the bug with return value from (*pc)() in recXfile().
	 [xymodem.c]
	-generalised purgemenu(), producing userlist_menu().  Changed [P] and
	 [W] from sysop cmd: menu to point to new function.  Removed
	 purgemenu() declaration from citadel.h (serves me right for having
	 it there in the first place... it should have been static.)  Also
	 renamed ctdlpurg.mnu to ctdllist.mnu, in line with its newfound
	 generality.  [dosysop.c, citadel.h, ctdllist.mnu]

90Oct01  citadel 1.30-30
	-did some global consistency-checking and fixing of multitasking-
	 friendliness.  Ensured that xprintf() is called instead of printf(),
	 etc.  [a lot of files]

90Oct03  citadel 1.30-31
	-properly finished adding support for single-mode C86-style file
	 requests (see 1.30-28.)  Added code to flingfile() to check for
	 existence of requested file(s) (which it didn't do before; it would
	 just silently quit without sending anything...), to handle
	 single-mode, and general clean-up.  [netrcv.c]

90Oct06  citadel 1.30-32
	-fixed globFloor() so that it takes the user to all floors, not just
	 the current one.  [floor.c]

90Oct08  citadel 1.30-33
	-fixed xputs() to use "fputs(s, stdout)" rather than "puts(s)".
	 [sysdep.c]
	-increased stksize to 10k. [ctdl.c]

90Oct17  citpeek
	-added somewhat skeletal showlog() module to citpeek. [citpeek.c]

90Oct18  *** v1.30 public release ***

	 [CONTINUED IN INCREM.2]
