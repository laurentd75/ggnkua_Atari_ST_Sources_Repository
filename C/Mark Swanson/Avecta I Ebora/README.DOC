Instructions for compiling and linking the game AVECTA I.

In this archive are all the necessary O files to link the game
AVECTA I.  The necessary programs are link68, relmod, bat, and rm,
all of which are available on the old developer's kit which DRI
sold.  I have supplied the link line file, denoted l, which assumes
that all the O files are on the A disk, as well as the batch file
necessary to accomplish the linking. (SLINK.BAT)  If you are linking
from a hard disk, or ramdisk, or whatever, you must tell the linker
where the O files are located.  The source code for all the C files
is also on this disk.  There are also several assembly language
files; these have the extension S.
