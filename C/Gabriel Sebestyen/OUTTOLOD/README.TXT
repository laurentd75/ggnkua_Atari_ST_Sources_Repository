
Here is a simply toolkit to convert *.OUT to *.LOD !
I had to write it because I have a f*cker assembler
it uses the OUT format !
You can use it very simply : just call the OUTTOLOD.TTP
with your *.OUT filename ...
'coz you got this package you won my present:
a Unix To Dos ( sorry Tos ) textfile converter program !
( Be happy ! )
You can use wildcards too as parameter !

See ya !
