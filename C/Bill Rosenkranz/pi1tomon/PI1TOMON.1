        pi1tomon - convert and display Degas .PI1 file in monochrome 

SYNOPSIS  
        pi1tomon [-t] [-i] [-90 | +90] file ...  

DESCRIPTION  
        Pi1tomon  uses  the Floyd-Steinberg error distribution algorithm
        to display  low  resolution  Degas  images  (.PI1  files)  on  a
        monochrome display.    So  far  it can only display the original
        320x200 images in 320x200 pixels on the monochrome monitor.   It
        maps  the  palette contained in the file to a relative intensity
        level such that pixels with color index of 0x000 are  black  and
        those with color index 0x777 are white.  Intermediate colors are 
        mapped to intermediate shades.  

        The -i  option  inverts  black  and white.  The -t option causes
        pi1tomon to use a 3 by 3 neighborhood for distributing the error 
        rather than the default 2 by 2.  The image can be rotated +90 or 
        -90 degrees as well, -90 being clockwise.
