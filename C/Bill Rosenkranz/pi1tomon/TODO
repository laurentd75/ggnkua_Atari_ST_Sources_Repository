now, how to make a 320x200 image fill a mono screen (640x400). perhaps
interpolating between existing pixels to get the missing ones? maybe it
would be better to fit a spline/surface between 4/16 points, respectively.

other things to do:

	* rotate image +/- 90 deg (done)

	* change palette

	* multiple files (done)

	* dump to .pi3

	* error checking (if internal res does not match extension)

	* histogram (done)

	* 3x3 option (done)

probably more...
