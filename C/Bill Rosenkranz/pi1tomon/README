pi1tomon - display degas .pi1 (low res) image on monochrome monitor

i had tried to persuade some others to let me have the src to the
floyd-steinberg algorithm for displaying multi-shade images on bi-level
(i.e. monochrome) devices. no luck. couldn't even BUY it! so i dug
up a reference on it and wrote my own. this could be the kernel of
a monochrome imaging system for someone to write. does not use gem
(enter command from shell). uses line_a for put_pixel, draw_line.

this was really a quick hack to see how floyd-steinberg dithers works.
pretty well, considering it took only a couple hours. it reads in degas
(uncompressed) .pi1 files and dithers with the f-s error-distribution
algorithm. monochrome only!

uses 2x2 or 3x3 neighborhood. only displays 320x200 image on mono screen.
does not handle .pi2 (med res) yet. lets u rotate image +/-90 deg. displays
(rather wimpy) histogram representing color/number of pixels of that color
(there are 16 colors in a .pi1). should be easy to add a new palette on
the command line (e.g. "-p000111222333444555666777..." or somesuch).

see man page for more info. both nroff source and nroff output included.
i suppose i should update my earlier nroff(1) post (it now supports .if
and some more things). i have also included pieces of my line_a library
to be able to link this. src and .a included for that.

also included is a .pi1 sample file to play with. it was converted to .pi1
from a .spc (spectrum) so it is not the greatest image. i used iffcnv to do
it. still, it is the ill-fated SR-71 Blackbird so i can live with it...

use as u like. no restrictions.
