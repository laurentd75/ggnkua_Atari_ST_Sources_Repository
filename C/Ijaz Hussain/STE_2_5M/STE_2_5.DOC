                   STE 2.5 MEGABYTE INSTALLER
                   BY JAZZBOX INC

WRITTEN USING PROSPERO C ON A 2 MEGABYTE STE (NOW 2.5 MEG)

THIS PROGRAM IS PUBLIC DOMAIN YOU ARE FREE TO COPY,DISTRIBUTE,
EAT OR CHANGE THIS PROGRAM IN ANY WAY YOU FEEL. YOU MAY NOT
SELL THIS PROGRAM FOR PROFIT.
                   
DISCLAIMER
----------
I ACCEPT NO RESPONSIBILITY TO THE USAGE OR INABILITY TO USE THIS
PROGRAM IN ANY WAY. THE USER USES IT AT HIS/HER OWN RISK.

WHAT IT DOES?
-------------
THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS AN STE OWNER TO HAVE 2.5 MEGABYTES OF MEMORY
ON HIS SYSTEM.

WHEN YOU UPGRADE YOUR STE FROM 1.0 MEGABYTES TO 2.0 MEGABYTES YOU
HAVE TO REMOVE FOUR 256K SIMMS AND REPLACE THEM WITH TWO 1024K SIMMS.
BECAUSE OF THE WAY ATARI HAVE DESIGNED THE STE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE
TO MIX 256K SIMMS AND 1024K SIMMS. 

THIS TRADITIONALLY MEANS YOU HAVE FOUR SIMMS WHICH YOU LONGER HAVE
ANY USE FOR AND THE NORMAL PROCEDURE IS TO EITHER THROW THEM AWAY
OR SELL THESE AS TWO ONE MEGABYTE UPGRADES AT A NOMINAL PRICE.

IN THE STFM IT WAS POSSIBLE TO HAVE 2.5 MEGABYTES OF MEMORY AND THIS
IS WHAT GAVE ME THE IDEA TO WRITE THIS PROGRAM. THE REASON WHY YOU 
CAN'T HAVE A 2.5M MEMORY CONFIGURATION IS BECAUSE OF A BUG IN 
TOS 1.6. I USED A SOFTWARE FIX TO GET AROUND THIS PROBLEM AND 
TESTED THE PROGRAM ON A STE WITH ITS COVER REMOVED.

BEFORE USING THE PROGRAM
------------------------
THERE ARE TWO THINGS YOU NEED TO DO BEFORE YOU CAN USE THIS PROGRAM

        1) CREATE A BOOT DISC
        2) OPEN YOUR MACHINE AND INSERT THE 256K SIMMS
        
COPY THE PROGRAM STE_2_5.PRG INTO A AUTO FOLDER, IT MUST BE THE FIRST
PROGRAM TO BE RUN. ALSO MAKE SURE YOU KEEP A COPY OF YOUR BOOT DISC 
OTHERWISE IF THE DISC BECOMES CORRUPTED AND RENDERED USELESS
YOU WILL NEED TO RE-OPEN YOUR MACHINE ,REMOVE THE SIMMS , CREATE 
ANOTHER BOOT DISC, RE-INSERT THE SIMMS ETC.

THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY TESTED AND WORKS WELL EVEN ON A 
FRIEND'S STFM WITH SIMM EXPANSION (I DON'T KNOW WHY HE DIDN'T GET
2.5 MEGS IN THE FIRST PLACE). 








SIMM INSTALLATION
-----------------
THE SINGLE IN-LINE MEMORY MODULES(SIMMS) NEED TO BE INSTALLED AS
FOLLOWS:-


              BACK OF STE
                
     |=========== 1024K SIMM ========|  SLOT 1
     |=========== 256K  SIMM ========|  SLOT 2
     |=========== 1024K SIMM ========|  SLOT 3
     |=========== 256K  SIMM ========|  SLOT 4
     
              FRONT OF STE
              
THE SIMMS MAY NEED QUITE FIRM PRESSURE TO MAKE THEM GO IN PROPERLY.

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE THE POWER IS OFF WHEN YOU INSERT THE SIMMS
AND OPENING A MACHINE LESS THAN A YEAR OLD INVALIDATES ITS WARRANTY.

USING THE PROGRAM
------------------
INSERT YOUR BOOT DISC AND THE PROGRAM WILL DISPLAY IT'S
INSTALLATION MESSAGE AND RESETS THE MACHINE. YOU NOW HAVE
AN EXTRA HALF MEGABYTE OF RAM.

IT IS POSSIBLE TO RUN AUTO-BOOTING GAMES BY PRESSING <ALT>,<DEL> AND 
<CONTROL> AND INSERTING THE GAME DISC.
