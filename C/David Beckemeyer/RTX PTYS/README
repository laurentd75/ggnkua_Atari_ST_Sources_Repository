RTX PTYS

Enclosed is the PTY driver for RTX and a demo program to show how they
can be used.

You need Micro RTX to use RTX PTYS.  Micro RTX was posted earlier.
If you don't have it, see the end of this file for how to get it.

The files included here are:

	PTYDVR.PRG	- The RTX PTY driver
	RTXPTY.DOC	- Docs for the using the RTX PTY driver
	PTYWIN.PRG	- Hack of UW that uses PTYs instead of RS-232
	PTYINIT.PRG	- Program to startup PTYWIN
	RGETTY.PRG	- Really simple version getty for PTYWIN testing
	CLI.PRG		- Really simple CLI for PTYWIN testing

Also included is the C source to the demo programs and some misc. files
needed for PTYWIN.PRG.  The source to PTYWIN is available, but I didn't
put it in this set.  If you would like it, contact me at the address
given at the end of this file.  If I get enough requests I could post it.

The PTYs can be used stand-alone or with MT C-Shell (tm).  I have included
enough programs to run the PTY Windows program without anything else needed.
The PTYWIN program will also easily fit into the MT C-Shell system.

Here's how to use it stand-alone:
	1) Put all the files in the same place.
	2) Create a \BIN folder on the same drive as these files.
	3) Copy the demo RGETTY.PRG file to \BIN.
	4) Make a copy of CLI.PRG and call it \BIN\CSH.PRG

Start the PTYINIT.PRG program from the Desktop.  This will load the
PTYDVR driver and then run PTYWIN.  PTYWIN will open one window and
run the RGETTY program inside that window.  The demo RGETTY will
start the simple CLI program (renamed to CSH).  The little CLI
program will give you a '$' prompt and you can type commands into
the top window.  You can open a new PTY window from the "Windows"
menu. Each window is a VT-52 emulator.  Any TOS or TTP programs that
use GEMDOS Standard I/O can be run inside a PTY window.

You can replace the included RGETTY and CLI programs with the shell
of your choice.  This shell must use GEMDOS for I/O (standard handles
0, 1, and 2).

Here's how to use PTYWIN with MT C-Shell:
	1) Copy the files to your MT C-Shell partition
	2) Obtain the "real" RGETTY program (not the demo)
	3) Start MT C-Shell with INIT2 and login.
	4) Type "ptydvr" to load the PTY driver.
	5) Start PTYWIN by typing "gem ptywin".

You should NOT use the dummy RGETTY or CLI programs with MT C-Shell.
A version of RGETTY for MT C-Shell is availabe from the BDT BBS (see
address below).  Also just use the normal MT C-Shell CSH program, not
the brain damaged CLI program included in this distribution.

You can automatically load the PTYDVR in MT C-Shell by including a line
with the path to the PTYDVR program in \etc\inittab.  If you do this,
you must then skip step 4 above when you want to run PTYWIN (because
the PTY drivers will aready be loaded).

The BDT BBS has the MT C-Shell RGETTY program as well has the MICRORTX
shareware distribution. It is availale 24hrs a day at (415) 530-9682.
