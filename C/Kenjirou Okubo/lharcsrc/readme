                                                        April 4, 1989

The accompanying document is a draft of my personal interpretation of 
the LHarc User Manual in Japanese contained in LHARC10D.COM.  It has
been reviewed by Mr. Haruhiko Yoshizaki, author of LHarc.

I have tested command lines in this English version with
LHARC10E.COM extracted LHARC.EXE 1.00 except for the switching
character.

The machine I used for the test is Toshiba T5100 with MSDOS 3.30
from Toshiba.  The machine is one of those PC-Compatibles.

I do welcome comments on faults in this document in any respect,
language, usage or style.

I am willing to revise, and am actually planning to revise this
document. For the people in U.S. unfamiliar with Japanese archivers,
I think I have to upload the twin archive tool LARC by K. MIKI, very
soon.

Please notify to the address K. Okubo on GEnie for any comments or
questions.
                                        - Kenjirou Okubo
