PC-DOS/MS-DOS:
==============

    The following sources are need for this version:

    - LHARC.C   --> the main program
    - HUF.ASM   --> the encoding/decoding routines
    - LZS.ASM   --> some other functions
    - UTIL.C    --> some useful utility-functions
    - EXECUTE.C --> function to load and execute a program
    - USAGE_E.H --> English usage and error-messages
    - USAGE_J.H --> Japanese usage and error-messages
    - SFX.ASM   --> startup-code for self-extracting-programs (small model)
    - SFX2.ASM  --> startup-code for self-extracting-programs (large model)
    - MAKEFILE  --> the makefile

    You need following tools to recompile this program.

          1. tcc.exe
          2. tlink.exe
          3. make.exe
          4. bgiobj.exe
             Turbo C v.1.5 is used. You need some modification with TC 2.0.
          5. optasm.exe
             Ver. 1.5. You cann't do with Masm v.4.0,or v.5.1 or Tasm.
          6. exe2bin.exe
          7. symdeb.exe
             These 2 were from MS-DOS v.3.3.

    You have to place these tools in your directories specifed with PATH.
    You, also, need to place \include, \lib by turboc.cfg file.

    Then type
         make or
         make -Dlang=English    for English version.
         make -Dlang=Japanes    for Japanese version, this may not work.?


ATARI ST:
=========

    You need Turbo-C 1.1 to recompile the program.

    The following sources are need for this version:

    - LHARC.C   --> the main program
    - HUF.C     --> the encoding/decoding routines
    - LZS.C     --> some other functions provided by 'LZS.ASM'
                    in MS-DOS version
    - UTIL.C    --> some useful utility-functions
    - USAGE_E.H --> English usage and error-messages
    - LHARC.PRJ --> the project-file to compile with Turbo-C 1.1

    To recompile the program start the program 'TC.PRG' and
    then load the project-file 'LHARC.PRJ' by choosing the
    Item 'Select...' from the Project-Menu. Then type ALT-M to make
    the program.

    Differences to the MS-DOS version of the program:
    -------------------------------------------------
        
    1. Self-Extraction-Files are NOT supported. So the command 's'
       and the option '/k' don't work.
    2. If you abort the program by pressing Ctrl-C, the old filenames
       will NOT be restored. So e.g. if you were updating an archive,
       the old archive may be renamed to 'archive.)2(' (see user-manual).
    3. Extraction from LArc-Files is not *tested*.
    4. If you use the new option '/h' the program waits for a keystroke 
	   after execution. This is necessary when using it from the desktop.
    5. The default pager-utility is called 'less.ttp' rather then
       'less.com'.
