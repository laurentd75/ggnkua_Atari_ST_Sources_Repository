                          TCB TRACKER IN STOS
                          ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

     Soon after seeing the Monster Sound Cartridge in action, playing 
TCB Sound Tracker music in stereo it was a must to get STOS 
playing it aswell in Stereo using the Monster Cartridge. Along 
with the demo was a number of player routines for use with other 
basics such as Hisoft and GFA. Along with these was piece of 
68000 code to play TCB modules in stereo. At first I started off 
with the GFA source code, but this proved to be unfriendly to 
STOS and caused it to bomb out. After making a number of 
alterations with no luck I decided to go at it the 68000 way. By 
making a number of changes to the 68000 source code and loading 
the assembled code into STOS and calling the routines I soon had 
success, I had TCB tracker music running in Stereo in STOS and it 
hadn't taken to long. Before I could use the 68000 code in STOS I 
had to remove or alter parts of the source code, these where as 
follows.....

     1) Remove code to enter SUPERVISER mode. STOS runs in 
        SUPERVISER mode.
     
     2) Remove code to return to USER mode. This would really 
        B**G*R STOS up completely.

     3) Change exit procedure - Did use TRAP#1, but now uses a 
        RTS (Return).

     Well that was about all I did to get it to work but there 
are a number of problems still to be faced when using TCB modules 
in STOS - Currently no player routines available will play on an 
interrupt, and so nothing else can be done whilst the routine is 
running. - It's difficult to change the module that is playing as 
it is included in the assembled code, a number of attempts were 
made to change this but with no success. (The module can be 
changed by editing the 68000 source code) - Every time you run 
the Tracker routine it pokes variables into itself, and so will 
only work once before being reloaded, this causes no real problem 
unless you are experimenting with the routine.  

     Using this new theory of writing 68000 code and operating it 
from STOS has porved to be a great success in the last couple of 
days that THB have been working on it. We now have managed to 
write some very niffty 68000 code and use it in STOS along with 
the usual STOS commands. Don't forget use can't damage your 
computer by messing about with 68000 source codes and the STOS 
commands. Thats how I got the TCB Tracker routine to work.
