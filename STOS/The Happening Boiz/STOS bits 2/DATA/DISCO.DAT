Dance Music Fact or Fiction ?

The S.U. have spent vast quantities of hard sponds on big loud
speakers, oodles of flashing lights and the luxury of D.J.s being
able to lock themselves away from the Proles.  Students no longer
have to thump each other struggling to hear a walkman playing The
Cult thru' two shoeboxes.  Thank God for that.

But we have a new dilemma of monstrous proportions.  As fab and
groovy Ents D.J.s, we spend literally seconds carefully selecting
old and new tunes, mainly old because Ents haven't lashed out on
any new records since the Birdie song was a smash.  We manage to
create a pulsating mass of drunken bodies in Hutton Hall, we try
to choke them with the smoke machine, and blow their pickled
minds with loadsastrobe, and we even ignore the stupid requests
for records like The End by The Doors.

Then we're faced with the dilemma !!!.

What do you say to the Brain surgeon who sloths up to the D.J.
booth, proceeds to swing around on the edge, ignoring the
warnings about breaking the Perspex front, and shouts

                   CAN YOU PLAY SOME DANCE MUSIC !!

We stare out in wonderment over the seething mass of happy faces,
flailing arms and stonking legs. We turn to each other, then to
Tarzan, King of the Disco, (Still swinging merrily) and muse,

IF THE MUSIC WE'RE PLAYING THAT THE RABBLE ARE DANCING TO ISN'T
DANCE MUSIC, THEN WHAT IS ??.

The only answer we can come up with is ANY TYPE OF MUSIC WE
AREN'T PLAYING AT THAT INSTANT IN TIME IS DANCE MUSIC.

Can any one help clarify the difference between dance music, and
dance music ?.

P.S. Another starter for 10, What the HELL is PROPER MUSIC ??!!,
asked for by another Brain surgeon during a similarly packed
dance floor experience.
