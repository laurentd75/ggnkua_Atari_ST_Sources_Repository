     Dennis and Denise is like most a good Budgie release. On 
boot up the game starts of with the typical of Budgie bad 
graphics and welcome. Dennis and Denise has a load of text about 
pressing space to play and any other key for desktop. Though 
being able to go to the desktop is a good idea and Budgie like 
all of their software to work like this, it puts me off the 
game. A lot depends on a persons first impressions of game. Once 
you've actually got into the game things start to look a little 
bit better, the high score routine looks plain but very neat and 
easy to look at. Once you have pressed fire to play you come to I 
would call a dead end, before you can play you have to enter the 
password for a level greater than one or just return to start off 
at level one, the trouble is that you have to enter the password 
using a rotating highlight around the letters of the alphabet 
arranged in a circle on the screen. I wrote a routine similar to 
this for a game but when I was finished it was so unfriendly that 
I scraped for the good old large attractive font and you just 
typed in the password (in my case your name), I wish Philip had 
done this. When trying to enter a password it kept coming up with 
more than one letter of the one that was currently highlighted so 
when trying to type 'HAPPYSAD' (The password for level two) you 
would have entered 'HHAPPPYYSAAD'

     Once you have taken control of Dennis the game becomes quite 
fun (I found it a bit difficult). You move across the screen 
jumping over laser beams and dodging bullets (It's like hunch 
back - Ed) This is quite enjoyable (If you any good at this kind 
of game) and certainly worth far more than many of the œ9.99 
commercial budget games. The levels get progressively more 
difficult (That's why I only know the password for level two) and 
so a lot of practice would be needed to complete the whole game in 
one go. The graphics is good and gives the game a very good 
atmosphere, shame the music isn't as good as the graphics.

     Overall a brilliant game spoilt by some of the usual Budgie 
ideas. I'd go out of my way to buy it tomorrow, if I didn't have 
three copies already.
