                    The 4th 16 BIT SHOW - Round Up

     As usual the 16 BIT SHOW was held at the Novotel in 
Hammersmith, London. Getting to the show was no difficulty, easy 
acces was given by the Hammersmith Underground station within 
spitting distnace of the Novotel. THB travelled by car from 
Suffolk to Seven Sisters underground and then through the 
underground system to the Hammersmith station. The roads were 
good and the underground was not too overcrowded, well it was 
overcrowded (As usual - Ed) but we still managed to carry and 
Amiga (Games Machine) in a plastic carrier bag(All it deserves - 
Ed) with out it getting damaged. Once at the Novotel the ques 
weren't yet very long but we had fast lane tickets anyway so 
entry was easy and quick. Be warned the later you get there the 
worse the que and the less chance of actually getting in.

     Before letting anyone into the building you must fill in you 
visitor form which allows companies such as Microdeal to spread 
their latest adverts and brochures. This can often be of use as 
we filled in our forms last year and were sent details of fast 
lane tickets and reduced prices so this can be one advantage.

     The show was spread across two floors of the building. 
Access from one floor to the other was via a one set of stairs, 
what was bad about this was the stairs lead down and met the 
lower floor next to the bar which meant the stairs where often 
blocked at the bottom by people drinking or eating. By early 
morning it began to get crowded and you were left standing around 
or being pushed around in huge jams of people. This was often 
very annoying as you had little chance to see any things on the 
stalls, which evaids the whole point of going to the show. One 
easy way around this over crowding is to get to the show as early 
as possible, have a look around at each stall in comfort, decide 
what you want to go back to if you want to enquire about or buy 
something, then get out and go home.

     If you go in a group my advice is to split up and meet in 
one place and at one time every so often, so then you can decide 
when to go and you don't make the other members of the group 
follow you around in the jams, theres nothing more irritating 
than been made to fight your way through a crowd to get somewhere 
you don't even want to get to.

     I was sent off to purchase a set of DRAMs to upgrade a 
520STFM with a Xtra-Ram boosting it's memory from one Mb to two and a 
half Mb, well, what caught my eye was the cheepness (Still 
expensive) of upgrades, once 100 quid they where now 
selling for as little 29 quid for a half to one Mb upgrade. 
Frontier Software (Xtra-Ram) where selling one Mb to two and a 
half Mb upgrade for its Xtra-Ram board at œ59.99.

     The show is definataly the best time to buy small peices of 
hardware such as Samplers, Upgrades or Disks. Make sure if you 
buy anything like a sampler or upgrade that you get a reciept, 
else you may as well have sent you money to THB (we would give 
you a free disk with some of our software on it)

     Well it's about time I wound this article up, don't you 
think. Well here we go, the last sentence is coming up.

     If you can get there, the 16 BIT SHOWS are worth a visit.
