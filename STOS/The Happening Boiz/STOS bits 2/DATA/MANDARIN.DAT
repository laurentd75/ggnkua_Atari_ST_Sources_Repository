                            SOFTWARE

By Leon O'Reilly of Disk-Maggie

     Eddie  asked  me to write a guest article for his  new  disk 
magazine, so here it is!

     Back  in the good 'ol days of the ST,  Mandarin were one  of 
the  leading software houses pioneering the realm of quality  16-
Bit products.  There race game,  Lombard RAC Rally stayed in  the 
chart  for  years (It's now top of the ST  budget  charts!),  and 
they made a wide range of applications including the mini  office 
series.  But  perhaps their most successful venture  was  carried 
out in the programming field when Francois Lionet and  Constantin 
Sotiropoulos created STOS basic.  This was a high-level  language 
which allowed users to easily access  sprites,  music,  scrolling 
and  more  without  an indepth  knowledge  of  the  ST.  Hardened 
programmers  criticised  its simplicity and  speed.  The  general 
public lapped it up and it sold in massive  quantities.  Mandarin 
claim  that  it  has shifted 150,000 units and  now  that  it  is 
bundled with the ST, this is a figure that can but increase.
     The language's popularity makes Mandarin's current  attitude 
a  mystery.  Originally Francios Lionet was going  to  completely 
rewrite  STOS,  removing bugs and improving its speed as well  as 
adding  a  series of extra commands.  But Franny had  to  do  his 
national service,  and Mandarin lost interest in the  idea.  With 
the  release  of the STE,  many thought that  Mandarin  would  be 
forced  to  release a completely upgraded version  of  STOS,  but 
they  simply  released  a patch to get round the  bugs  that  the 
STE's TOS caused.
     STOS users, disappointed that their language wasn't going to 
be  fully  upgraded,  were appeased with the news  that  Mandarin 
were  releasing a series of STOS programs that could be  used  in 
conjunction with the language;  STOS-Vidi and STOS musician  were 
just two of the programs heavily featured in the STOS  newsletter 
which  Mandarin has now scrapped.  The release of  STOS  musician 
was  delayed  because  of the STE's  introduction  with  its  two 
channel stereo sound.  STOS musician is being re-written,  but it 
is doubtful that it will see the light of day.
     Mandarin's  only new release in the STOS field is  STOS  3D. 
This contains 31 extra commands, but do STOS coders really want a 
3D  extension?  Anyone  who wants a simple yet effective  way  of 
creating  3D games will buy Incentive's 3D construction  kit  and 
those who want to make Overlander beating 3D demos will resort to 
machine  code.  This  program really falls between  two  definite 
market  groups  and I doubt it'll be that much of  a  success.  A 
person  heavily  involved in the STOS field  has  described  this 
module as no more than 'a joke'.
     Mandarin  have now turned their eyes to the Amiga and  their 
new  products  are being designed for this virus  ridden  console 
with keys.  When asked if they were going to upgrade  STOS,  they 
retorted  that  a  language  that had  sold  150,000  copies  was 
obviously  good enough and didn't need to be  upgraded.  This  is 
absolute rubbish, STOS is in dire need of a replacement language. 
Too  many  people  are abondoning it and  moving  over  to  other 
languages  whether  it's basics like GFA,  Hisoft  or  onto  6800 
programming with Devpac.
     Mandarin's  casual attitude is going to be  their  downfall. 
Even though some excellent results can be achieved with STOS,  it 
isn't  a very well respected language amongst the  ST  community, 
many sneer at it and the similarity between STOSSERS and  another 
word in the English vocabularly has provoked untold mirth amongst 
some people.
     Mandarin have to start taking both the ST and STOS seriously 
if they want their program to continue in the success it has  had 
over  the  last  two and a half years.  They have to  give  it  a 
complete  overhaul or release some good new modules  for  it.  If 
they continue in the way that they are going,  STOS has the  life 
expectency of the Sinclair C5.
