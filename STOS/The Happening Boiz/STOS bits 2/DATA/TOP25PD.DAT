                      The Top 25 PD Games

     Welcome  to the top 25 public domain games available  at  the 
moment.  Must  of these are at least as good as  their  commercial 
counter  parts  and  well worth spending three quid  or  less  on. 
Notice that there are 9 Budgie UK licenceware games in the top 25.
Not bad Huh ?
    This  chart includes the ST Format percentages for  each  game  
cos its the best ST magazine around for PD software coverage ( and 
for most other things aswell ). 

1)  Llamatron                                                  95%
  Has everyone gone over the top on this game or wot  ?  Admitedly 
it  is one of the best PD ( Shareware actually ) games around  but 
its still not perfect, yet every computer magazine just won't shut 
up about it.  Well I'm getting a bit bored with it all ( and a bit 
jealous aswell ).

2)  Bolo                                                       93%
   A breakout game.  Sometinmes I think that there are only  three 
types of game in the PD,  breakout,  boulderdash and  pacman.  The 
place  is  full of them.  why can't we  have  something  original. 
However  as  breakout games go this is the best of its  type  with 
many  original features not even found in comercial versions  even 
if it does lack a bit of colour.

3) Dizzy Lizzy 2    ( Budgie licenceware )                     92%
    I  seem  to recognize this from somewhere but  I  can't  think 
where.  A boulderdash game (seee I told you) with superb  graphics 
and good gameplay and a smattering of originality, but not much.

4) Spectral Sorcery                                            92%
     This has been around for sometime now and was excellent  when 
it first came out.  It still is.  Highly original and great fun to 
play if you're into strategy boardgames.

5) Cooltetris                                                  91%
     One of the best tetris variants in the Public  domain.  There 
not much mopre I can say really.  If you don't know what tetris is 
then  sell your computer and become a buddhist monk ( mind you  if 
you've never heard of Tetris you probably are a buddhist monk ).

6) From Little Acorns ( Budgie UK )                            90%
    An excellent RPG/adventure based around the hobbit. Great fun.

7) Ball Blazer                                                 90%
    Very similair to an old game that I had on the Spectrum called 
Trailblazer. steer your ball down a perspective track jumping over 
holes and trying to hit the colored tiles to get power  ups.  Very 
fast.

8) Electronic jigsaw                                           90%
    Hmmm.  I'm not quite sure how this got here.  It's a  computer 
version of those old hand held puzzles that everyone had when they 
were kids,  where you had to slid the tiles around to make up  the 
picture.  nice graphics but it could get very boring and is really 
up there with the best.

9) Dark Wars ( Budgie UK )                                     87%
     I can't really say much about this as I wrote it,  but I  can 
tell you that its a role playing game thats a cross between  Bards 
tale and Dungeon master and there may be a sequel coming out soon.

10) The Pay Off                                                 87%
     A  good text and graphics adventure where you have  to  raise 
money  to pay off the local mafia to stop them  doing  unspeakably 
nasty things to you.

11) Micheals Big Adventure                                     86%
      A fun graphic adventure aimed more at children  than  anyone 
else.  Simple graphics and the game isn't to complex but it should 
appeal to kids.

12) Exodus ( Budgie UK )                                       85%
    A great scrolling shoot'em up with very good graphics and game 
play. 

13) Pop Eyed                                                   85%
    Phwoar.  This is more like it, a strip pop quiz with some very 
nice  graphics and unlike must strip games it is actually  fun  to 
play aswell.

14) Mix 'n' Match                                              85%
    Another strange one this.  It is one of those games where  you 
have  to guess where the pairs are and match them up.  It's  quite 
good fun but a bit simple and lacking on gameplay compared to  the 
others in this list.

15) Master Break                                               84%
     Another breakout game.  This one is colourful with some  nice 
graphics and quite addictive.

16) Skull Diggery                                              84%
    A boulderdash game.  This is very similair to Douglas Rockmoor 
but if anything is not quite as good.

17) Pacman ST ( Budgie UK )                                    83%
     The  best Pacman game available.  Fast colourful and  with  a 
large  play  area ( the screen scrolls up  and  down).  Chioce  of 
traditional or modern styles.

18) Bert the Squirt ( Budgie UK )                              82%
     A simple platform game with OK graphics that is great fun  to 
play. One of the best platform games available.

19) Tetris                                                     82%
      Another  tetris game.  Very similair to Cooltetris  but  not 
quite as good.

20) Douglas Rockmoor ( Budgie UK )                             81%
       Yet  another  boulderdash game.  This is one  of  the  best 
however with fast scrolling and great gameplay. 

21) Space Blob   ( Budgie UK )                                 79%
        Another platform game that is fun to play.  Nice  graphics 
but a bit simplistic.

22) A Quest for Galaxia  ( Budgie UK )                         78%
     A version of the old game galaxia which itself was a  version 
of  space  invaders.  Another game that is fun to play but  a  bit 
simplistic.

23) Trax quiz                                                  78%
    A simple quiz game.  Not as good as Pop Eyed ( well it doesn't 
have the same incentives ).

24) Plumb crazy                                                76%
     A version of the commercial game Pipe Mania that is almost as 
good. Graphics are a bit simple but it has nice gameplay.

25) Hac-Man                                                    73%
     An average pac-man game.  There are better about ( see Pacman 
ST above ).  

  Well thats it,  the top 25 PD games according to ST  Format  and 
with  the  exception  of  a couple  they  really  are  very  good. 
Obviously  not all PD games have been reviewed and I for one  know 
of one or two other Budgie games that deserve to be in there.
