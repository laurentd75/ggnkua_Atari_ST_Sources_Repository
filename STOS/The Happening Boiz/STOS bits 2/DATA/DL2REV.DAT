 Game Review:

 Game    : DIZZY LIZZY II (A Winters Tale)
 Released: Budgie UK
 Price   : œ2.95
 Author  : THB

  A Winters Tale is the sequel to Dizzy Lizzy, and is the fourth 
THB game.  Winters Tale (henceforth referred to as DL2) follows 
the same plot as Dl1, namely collect all the diamonds from a 
screen.

  However, the game has been thoroughly revamped; you can tell 
this straight from bootup.  A nifty Budgie UK logo zooms towards 
you, before a set of film-style credits proclaim who the game was 
programmed by.  Playing throughout is a Shapeshifters rendition 
of Girls On Film, by Duran Duran.    Then comes the main option 
screen, also pretty good. This goes through the different blocks 
(that was my idea, remember, Eddie?).  This is where those 
familiar with DL1 notice the first major changes.  The familiar 
diamonds, boulders and bombs have vanished, and new transporters, 
doors and switches have been added.  It is possible to access 
instructions or high scores from here.   Pressing fire puts you 
into the password screen.  This is another little Eddie graphic 
masterpiece, but if I have to be pedantic I would have moved the 
password input.  The old DL1 sprites have been replaced by a bog-
standard font, but there is a scroller (penned by Ian) to keep it 
company.  It's difficult to say if this is an improvement or not 
(the big sprites in DL1 were quite stylish) but it does its job.

  The first thing you notice on entering the game is the 
graphics, again up to Eddies high standards.  Dizzy is outfitted 
in ski goggles, befitting the wintry theme.  Moving about, you 
are liable to walk into a cracker.  Bad move.  You die, and the 
screen swaps to a message screen, warning you of the dangerous-
ness of crackers.  A bit late though!
  The aim is to collect all the parcels on a level, presumably 
for delivery to your friends.  Crackers have already been noted, 
and the Christmas puddings are covered in explosive brandy which 
detonates when the pudding is allowed to fall, and will kill you 
if you do not take steps to avoid it.  One bug is that you can 
drop several puddings in a row and only the last will detonate.
  Snowballs are fatal if dropped onto you, and ice prevents you 
from stopping.  Rebounders at the end of runs of ice make you, 
surprisingly, rebound.  Safes are impossible to pass, but reveal 
parcels upon collection of the key.
  Two new features are included.  One is the transporter.  Moving 
onto this block, and pressing fire, you are instantaneously 
flicked to the other transporter on the screen.  This can be used 
in several ways, depending on who designed the screen!
  The other new feature is the door.  Doors are similar to safes, 
but they do not conceal anything.  Using the switch somewhere on 
the screen, the door can be opened and closed at will.  This is 
used, again, in various ways.  One of the most cunning is on one 
of my screens, where the door is used in a way I'm sure Eddie 
never dreamed of!
  The last creature is one of the most annoying.  The snowman (or 
Wayne, to DL1 fans) moves around, never actually killing you but 
being a pest.  While Wayne cannot kill you, if you move into him 
you die!  The only known way of disabling him is trapping him in 
a pudding explosion; more difficult than it sounds!

  Unlike DL1, the score, lives etc. are not displayed on the main 
game screen.  To see the scores you must press "M".  Then you get 
a screen with a series of informative statements.  These include 
the number of the screen you are on, the password, score, lives 
left, and current music.
  Pressing S switches off the "save score" feature, useful if you 
want to keep your disk write-protected.  The screen also features 
"the fastest STOS scroller" (Eddies words) which is 9 pixels 
high!
  Pressing "M" again puts you onto a music menu with another 
scroller.  You also get to chose from four festive tunes, 
programmed by some person called "The Cool Carrot".  In 
retrospect, a couple are okay, but they repeat too quickly.  
Pressing another key puts you back into the main game.
  When you are killed three times, you go onto the high score 
table.  If you are good enough, you can enter your name.  This 
section was one of the ones I criticised in my review of DL1 for 
Bits issue 1, and I am pleased to say that this version is much 
better.
  The score entry screen is functional, and the workings are 
quite good.  One criticism; the "delete" key deletes the entire 
name, instead of just one letter.  I can live with that, though!

  One other major problem I found with DL1 was that the screens 
were too easy.  This is not the case with DL2; the screens are 
pretty hard, and some indication of this can be gained from the 
fact it took me an hour to solve a screen I initially designed!
  The screens lead to the major problem I have found with DL2: it 
is impossible to complete!  Level 32 has been checked by both me 
and Eddie and it is formally declared impossible to complete, 
thus ensuring nobody can complete all forty screens!

  In conclusion, after a series of playtests, the game is as 
addictive as DL1, and even better presented.  I have only a few 
minor criticisms; in addition to the ones above, I would say the 
presents and crackers are too hard to distinguish at a glance.  
Apart from these, this is a game to be heartily recommended, even 
if only 32 of the 40 levels can be played!

 PS   Despite the fact it is August I'm saying it'll be good for
      winter nights. Why? Because Eddie is slow at finishing
      diskmags!    PM
