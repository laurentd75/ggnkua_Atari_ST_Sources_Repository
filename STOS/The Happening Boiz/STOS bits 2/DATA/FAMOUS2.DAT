          PRODUCING A COMMERCIAL COMPUTER GAME

1

To have any chance of success when producing a commercial game
you must first form a group of CODERS/GRAFIX MEN/MUSICIANS etc
This (as one might expect) allows experts to concentrate on
their own talents.

2
- 

Before even thinking of producing a game you must experiment,
this is achieved by writing DEMOs, Stretching the limits of
your programming knowledge. (Not very far in most cases) to
opening borders and doing hardware scrolling, etc.

So that people know who you are you need to think of a name 
for your group. Names that can be shortened to 3 letters are
generally the best. eg: T.E.X or B.B.C
Even better than that is to have a name that can be shortened
to T.something.B such as The Happening Boiz (T.H.B) or
The CareBears (T.C.B)

When you are famous demo writers you than need some capital 
behind you before producing your game. This is achieved by 
selling the 68000 source codes (generally undocumented)
at œ10 a screen to people who generally don't understand
what they are looking at but bought the source code because
you are "famous demo coders" and "I had to see how they
did it" (even though they don't own a copy of DEVPAC) and
have to fork out another œ60 just to assemble the screen.

Lets recap: You've formed a group
            You've thought of a name
            You've gained experiance and become famous
                   by writing demos
            You've got some capital behind you

            Nows the time to design the game.

We now have an extract in the birth of a new game.

GFX = GRAPHIX ARTIST
CODER = CODER (Rather obvious !)
MUSIX = Bet you can't guess !

Coder : What can our new game be ?

Musix : Beep, Beeeep, Beeeeeeeep No idea but I've
        already finished the music.

GFX   : I've got some grafix kicking around that I drew
        3 years ago and haven't been used.

 The game is now based soley around the 3 year old graphics
that are in a GREY palette and have no relevance to the 
storyline thought up. Now after weeks of hard work GFX 
returns with a new palette for the graphics that means all 
the rasters and colour detection have to be changed. Coder
gets so PI**ED OFF that the game is scrapped and another 
concept is produced.

The new idea consists of killing as many nasties as possible 
in a way no one has thought of before. This is the start all 
commercial game coders use, unless you work for SIERRA or
MICROPROSE. Graphics have to be as colourful as possible
this usually means BRIGHT GREEN mixed in with a BRIGHT PINK
nastie and a SICK COLOURED bonus item.

We now have the concept and the graphics all we need now
is the game code. Many people believe that new games take
months to write (look at BATMAN) this is total C*AP. 
Games actually take 3-4 DAYS to write and completely finish.
When we say days this means "DAYS" and not the 9-5 day many
people work. As we all know coders sleep in their chairs
and their hands continue to work, so in actual fact
coders are not known to sleep in a bed as many normal
people do. 
The time it takes to produce a new game can be further
reduced by reusing all those "little routines" you thought
might come in useful one day. This means games can be 
produced in 2 DAYS.
For optimum speed a SHELL is needed. this has all the 
routines you might need to use and you call each one
in the order you need.This method requires very little
additional code. The SHELL method has one vital
drawback, all games look the same (What ones don't 
anyway ?) and they all start with "Here we go!" and 
all the pictures are called *****_ptr.

(For those who dont know the "Here we go" and "***_ptr
are jokes about Budgie UK's shell)

We now have a game finished and we need someone to
advertise, distribute and package the game.
We have one of two choices:

A: approach a well known company and as them to
   sell the game.

B: approach someone noones ever heard of.

For a demo crew turned professional commercial software 
writers option A looks the best but opt for option B.

10
__

Selling the game. It is best to release a new game at
a large computer show. The 16 bit at the Novotel in
London is a good place. Flog the game at œ20 on the 
first day of the show and shift 10 copies.
On the second and third days reduce the price to œ15
and sell 50 copies.

If you need to increase the number of sales you can

A: allow one of the CREW to remove their exhibitors 
badge and play the game, making it look easy, thus 
increasing the sales to blood sucking , shoot em up
variation seekers.

B: allow a very small and young member of the crew 
to remove their badge and play the game deliberately
killing themselves occationally, to make the game look 
hard and thus increasing the sales to extreemly stupid
people who want to spent three days finishing the first 
level.

Money. After you recieve your first cheque for œ12.65
to be split between the 7 members of your CREW decide
to split up and send your foreign member back home.
