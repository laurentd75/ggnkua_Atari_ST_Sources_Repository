                    How to fit a memory Upgrade


     While I was at the 16 Bit show in July ( handy tip don't ever 
go to the 16 bit show if your claustrophobic......or if you  enjoy 
breathing for that matter.) I decided to buy a memory upgrade. Now 
the  bloke  on the stand said it was really easy  to  fit,  and  I 
thought as I know a bit about electronics it shouldn't be to  hard 
so  I bought one.  I better not name the company in case of  legal 
battles ( and I can't remember their name ). 
  So I took this thing back across london on the tube and then all 
the  way home while subjecting it to Ians driving ( I  would  have 
driven  but the Ferrari was in for servicing and I'd lent  my  mum 
the porsche ).  Anyway I got it home and opened the box.  Now  the 
box  was  about 4 foot by 4 foot by 2 foot and the  actual  memory 
upgrade was about 1 inch sqaure ( it took quite some time to  find 
it amongst the packaging ).  I finally got it out and then relised 
that  I  had  to take the computer apart so I  put  it  back  down 
again ....  and lost it. I decided that the best move was probably 
to  take  the computer apart anyway so I undid the screws  in  the 
back. Then I undid the screws in the front, then the screws in the 
side, then the screws in the disk drive until I had a pile about 2 
foot high by the side of me.  Did you know that if the ST had been 
glued together instead of screwed (oooh eeerrrr sounds a bit rude) 
it would have been half an inch square....  It's twoo,  it's twoo, 
it is.
      After  taking the back off I then tried to remove  the  disk 
drive. Now the manual said it was supposed to unplug fairly easily 
so I tried to easy the cable away from it. Then I tried with a bit 
more force, then I pulled it, then I yanked it and finally I tried 
to use a crow bar which broke in half but did mention to bend some 
of the pins on the drive,  so in the end I just left it plugged in 
and went on to remove the metal shield.  Now in the manual it says 
to use Long nose pliers,  could I find any long nose pliers  ?  In 
the  end  tried  a  pair of tweezers in  conjuction  with  half  a 
crowbar which worked quite well considering. Well it didn't say in 
the  instructions that the sheilding had to come of in  one  piece 
did it,  I mean how was I to know. I discovered that what I should 
be doing was taking the power supply out first,  so I tried again. 
The power supply was even harder to remove than the disk drive and 
it  made me wish that I'd saved the crowbar until  now.  Anyway  I 
finally removed it along with half the casing so now I had reached 
the dark depths of the inner sanctum, that which is know as.......       
...The Circuit Board........
 
         Will I succeed in Upgrading my ST ?
               Will the upgrade work ?
   Will Penelope be saved from the clutchs of the Evil Claw ?

        Tune in next week for another exciting episode of

                       THE MEMORY UPGRADE

    What is it next week already ?  My how time flies when  you're 
brain dead.

The story so far  -  I have fought my way down through the  perils 
of the casin and the Power Supply to the dread circuit board.  Now 
I can fit the memory Upgrade.  Well I can try. The instuction said 
the  small square bit could be pushed down onto the MMU.  It  also 
said  the MMU was either the C101601-38 or the C100109-001 or  the 
C025912-38  or the C025915-38 or the .......  and so on.  It  also 
said  the MMU was marked on the picture below.  Was  it  Bollocks. 
I  couldn't see a single nice freindly arrow or annotation on  the 
picture below at all in fact I could only just see the picture for 
that matter.  I finally decided that the MMU was the small  square 
chip  in the corner and proceeded to the easy pressing on  of  the 
board.  I  assume that by easy pressing on the  instructions  ment 
easily pressed on using a sledge hammer.  The next thing to do was 
remove the Video shifter so I opened its box pausing for a  moment 
to  wonder  why it was caged off all by it self before  trying  to 
remove it.  I soon found out why, the bloody thing bit me. There I 
was  one moment happily prizing it out and then the next there  it 
is  with hundreds of little fangs sticking into my thumb,  and  it 
hurt.  I  pulled it out bending itd legs in the process and had  a 
good cry in the corner before I could continue.  The  instructions 
said  I  had  to stick the Video shifter into the  socket  on  the 
circuit board so approaching very warily I did this.  Now I had to 
stick the new board into the old video shifter socket so that  the 
cable  was pointing up.  Then I found a bit of paper  saying  that 
this  should  infact read down.  This is all very well but  is  up 
towards  the  back  or the front of the ST and does  it  mean  the 
ribbon  coming  out of the first board  or  the  second.  Well,  I 
thought,  I'll put it in so that it looks like the pictures in the 
manuel.  I did this bendin a couple of transistors in the  process 
and than nearly cutting the cable in half while shutting the  cage 
on  the video shifter.  Then I put the computer back together  and 
had half the screws left over.
     Now came the moment of truth would it work ?  I switched  the 
computer on and nothing happened. Then I remembered to plug it in. 
I  tried  again.  The disk drive light came on.  The  screen  went 
black,  flashed green, went black again and stayed black. After 10 
minutes  I relised this wasn't supposed to happen  so,  with  some 
trepidation I took the whole thing apart again. AT this point Ian, 
who  had bought a memory upgrade as well phoned up.  He  said  his 
screen  had gone green and was doing nothing ( you see  there  are 
some people slower than me about ).  We decided the best thing  to 
do was to turn the memory Upgrade the other way up and try  again. 
I  did  this  and then did something you should never  ever  do  ( 
unless you are lazy ) and switched the computer on without putting 
it back together.  It worked.  I was so happy I managed to use  up 
almost all the screws while reassembling it.  It was at this point 
that  I realised that I didn't own any software that required  1MB 
to run, so I went down stairs to watch the telly.
