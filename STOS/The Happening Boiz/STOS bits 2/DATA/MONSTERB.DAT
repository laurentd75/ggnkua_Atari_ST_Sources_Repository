                        MONSTER BUSINESS 
                               BY
                         THE LOST BOYS

        MONSTER BUSINESS the first game released by THE
LOST BOYS shows a change from the usual shoot em up. 
In this game you carry an air pump with which you must 
blow up the nasties until they either BURST or FLOAT
away. Collecting bonuses as you go you must complete all
48 levels of the game with your 5 credits (each credit is
3 lives).
        The concept and graphics show originality which 
is expected from a group known for producing original 
demo screens/demos. After playing the game for a few days
you get used to the level layouts and monsters but the 
game being so different from other games has a lasting
appeal. The only real disappointment are the spot 
effects though the music is of a high standard.
