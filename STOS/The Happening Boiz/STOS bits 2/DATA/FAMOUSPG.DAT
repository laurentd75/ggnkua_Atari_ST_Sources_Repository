                    How to be a famous programmer

   It takes time, dedication, hard work and a  lot  of  talent  to 
produce a  superb piece of software.  For this reason many  people 
decide  that this is to much bother and go down the  pub  instead. 
Another  option is to claim that you are a really good  programmer 
and  release  some  load of drivel.  Since people  are  under  the 
impression  that  you are really good anything  you  release  will 
become a big hit.  For an example of this see the work of ........ 
(insert the name of your least favorite programmer. Eddie wouldn't 
let me put his name in ). 
   Below is a list of steps required to make people think you  are 
a good programmer.

1) Call yourself by a really stupid name.  Preferably one that can 
be  shortened to three Initial of which the first Letter is T  and 
the last is B. e.g. THB, TLB, TCB, TWB etc.
   The stupid name will not by itself make you famous but it  will 
automatically classify you in the group known as 'Programmers'.

2) Produce something really crap and then pretend it was something 
you  wrote  in your early days.  The actual date should  never  be 
specified  but  it should be sometime before the ST  was  actually 
released.

3) Steal everbody elses ideas and claim you thought of them first. 
It  is  always a good ploy to steal things from  other  computers, 
that way very few ST owners will have seen them before. 
WARNING: do not under any circumstances steal ideas from:
a) the ZX81, if you want to have any credibility at all
or
b) the Apple mac, unless you want to be taken to court.

4) Do not write anything in ST Basic.

5)  Never  admit  to writing in  anything  other  than  68000.  No 
programmers write Wholly in 68000 but they all claim that they  do 
and you should do the same even if you don't even know how to load 
Devpac.  (writing in C is considered accepatable in some areas but 
be wary.)

6)  If  you ever have to admit to writing in some  other  language 
always,  and  immediatly,  talk  about the new 50  layer  parallex 
scrolling,  super fast,  4096 colour, game, demo or word processer 
you happen to be writing in 68000, and don't forget to mention the 
soundtracker  music.  (phew that was a long  sentance).It  doesn't 
matter  what you claim as it is a well known fact that no  program 
'in  the  pipeline'  is ever released in  any  form  even  vaguely 
familair to that which is claimed.    

7)  Slag off all other programming groups at one point during  the 
program but don't forget to say hello to them in some other part.

8)   Always include a horrible sound chip tune,  a crap  scrolling 
message  and some vector balls if you want to be taken  seriously. 
It doesn't matter if you do happen to be writing a spreadsheet.

If  you follow these tips then,  while I cannot guarantee you  will 
become famous (despite what the title says,  Another  tip,  always 
make  claims  you can't live up to.) you will become at  least  as 
well known as other programmers such as the Red Duke.
