                         ICE-PACKER ROUTINES
                         ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

     After spending sometime altering 68000 programs that they 
were useable from within STOS, I took the chance to improve the 
quality of STOS software by giving every STOS user the chance to 
squeeze far more STOS banks and programs on to one disk. To do 
this I made a number of very small alterations to the ICE-
UNPACKER routines so that they, like the TCB Tracker routines, 
were compatible with STOS basic. 

     The ICE-PACKER routines are very effective and the files I 
have packed in the last couple of days, whilst working on the 
routines have been packed on average to about 44% of their 
original size, which means you could fit all the files from a 
Double sided disk onto a Single sided disk, which is a great news 
for all those single sided drive owners out their (Unlike me).

     The ICE-PACKER software is included on the disk for you to 
use on your own files along with the unpack source and STOS 
example. The ICE-PACKER program is called ICE-PACK.PRG and the 
unpacker program is called DE-ICER.PRG

     In order to use the DE-ICER program in STOS you have to 
follow the following rules of use.

     Load DE-ICER into memory bank
     
     Reserve memory bank for packed file

     Load packed file in to memory bank

     Reserve memory bank for unpacked file - Must be as big as 
     original unpacked code.

     Let register A0 = start (PACKED BANK)
     
     Let register A1 = start (UNPACKED BANK)

     Call DE-ICER
