My god!! he's back at last, now after 6-8 weeks of not doing any 
articles for the ne new issue of BITS, Eddie of the Happening 
Boiz is back, this time its only a short piece, this article is 
going to introduce the use of RESET routines in STOS programs, 
everybody knows that almost all demos have reset demos, so when 
you try a quit from the main demo, you get another screen, which 
you can't get out of, the routine in this article is only very 
simple, it just displays a screen!!, boring I know but 
music,noving sprites comes later, much later!, now onto the STOS 
source.....

Lines 70 - 210 these just set up the screen, get the palette of 
screen 15, reserve 32 bytes for the palette, then the palette of 
screen 15 is pushed into the 16 words in bank 2 using the DOKE, 
and DEEK commands.

Line 250 - AREG(0) is set to point at start(15) - this is the 
address of the picture data we want to display when the reset 
button is pressed.

Line 260 - AREG(1) is set to point at the palette data in bank 2, 
eg AREG(1)=start(2), simple eh??

Line 270 - CALL 1 , this is the machine code program that I 
wrote, this inititilises the reset routine, stores the position 
of the picture data, and paltte data, and returns.

Now when you press the button, you will get you picture on the 
screen!!!, remember, if you erase bank 15 or 2, AFTER the routine 
has been called, then when activated the computer MAY crash, also 
sometimes when you press reset the planes of the picture are 
shifted across, so the colours are all messed up,this can be 
cured by pressing it again!

Well thats it for this article..............Eddie 21 Oct '91
