OKAY LETS START WITH OUR OWN STUFF

RIGHT WE NOW HAVE 4 GAMES RELEASED THROUGH BUDGIE UK

SCARY, HOSTILE RECEPTION, DIZZY LIZZY, AND A WINTERS TALE.

I HAVE ALSO RELEASED A DOUBLE SIDED DISC FULL OF GAME SPRITES, 
THAT YOU CAN USE -- CALLED BUDGIE'S SPRITE PORTFOLIO.

IF YOU ARE INTRESTED IN LOOKING AT THE SOURCE CODES FOR OUR GAMES
THEN JUST SEND CHEQUE OR POSTAL ORDER FOR œ3.00 (MAKE IT PAYABLE 
TO EDDIE BRYAN.)

OTHER BUDGIE STUFF WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND --

ANYTHING BY THE LOST BOYS.

ANYTHING BY US (THB)

BUDGIE 68000 SHELL/MOVING BYTES - FOR ALL YOU 68000 CODERS.

MUSIC OF THE SHAPESHIFTERS - BY GOTH (THE BEST ST MUSIC MAN.)

ACE INVADERS/QUEST FOR GALAXIA - ATARI CLASSICS

INFERNO - BOULDERDASH CLONE - GOOD, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS A WINTERS 
                              TALE.

IF ANYBODY OWNS A MONO MONITOR AND IS PISSED OFF BECAUSE THEY 
CAN'T GET ANY GOOD GAMES TO RUN WITH IT, DON'T THROW YOUR ST AWAY 
AND SLIT YOUR WRISTS BECAUSE BUDGIE HAVE A COMPILATION DISC THAT 
FEATURES HOSTILE RECEPTION ( MONO CONVERTION BY MONOMAN ), WORD 
PUZZLE, AND OTHELLO.
