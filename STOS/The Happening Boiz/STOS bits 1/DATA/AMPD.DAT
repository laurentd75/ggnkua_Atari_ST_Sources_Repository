    Public Domain games have a long and distinguished tradition of
being crap and the truth is.....(This magazine will bring you  the
truth  ( unless you read the Sun in which case we promise to  give
you    loads   of   juicy   lies   and   words   of    only    one
sylbl..syble...sylablle....short words ) ).....most of them  still
are.  It all depends on what you are looking for. If you are after
some arcade action with super smooth scrolling excellent  graphics
and  presentation  with  that  one more go (  Cliche  number  1  )
addictiveness then you'll just have to write it yourself.  However
if all you want is playibility ( and who could ask for more )  and
don't care about presentation or the odd crash then you should  be
able to find something in amongst the multitude of mediocraty ( is
that how you spell it ? I should have paid attention in English. I
wasn't cut out to write magazine articles but thats my problem and
you  don't  want  to hear my problems,  or  perhaps  you  do.  You
disgusting perverts, I didn't mean any lies about me, or any truth
either ).  Where was I ......  erm ......  PD  ......  crap  .....
playability  .....  multitude  of  mediocraty (  thats  a  bit  of
alliteration  there.  See,  I  wasn't asleep in  all  the  English
lessons.  ) . For the inexperienced or just plain stupid  I  shall
explain what  PD software is and how it works. Anyone who  already
knows can bugger off.  Now,  do I have your full attention ? Good.
In  that  case I'll just go and turn my tape over  'cos  its  just
finished................  Hello again,  I'm back.  PD software  is
software  that can be obtained for free from a number  of  sources
mainly specialist Libraries,  Bulletin boards and User groups.  If
you  don't  understand any of these terms then get hold  of  'Your
Second ST Manuel' by Andreas Ramos which is also public domain and
is  excellent.   PD  software  is  devided  into  three  sections,
shareware,  where you are expected to donate a small ( or large  )
sum to the author if you enjoy or use the software a lot, Freeware
which is, as the name suggests, free, and Licenceware. Licenceware
is mainly organised by Budgie UK.  It is a system where the author
recieves  a small royalty on each copy sold.  Because of this  the
price  tends to be slightly higher ( usually about 20p )  but  the
quality also tends to be higher.  All of these types my be  freely
copied but not sold for profit. Okay, I think its  about  time  to
review some of the good, the bad and the ugly ( Cliche number 2 ).

Game: Escape
Author: Eric B. Lindros
Type: Shareware
Res: med/high

Review:
       This is one of those maze games which every computer  seems
to have and no one can quite work out why. The idea in this one is
(  as always ) to escape.  You are helped and hindered  by  bombs,
traps,  transporters,  doors,  monsters,  scrolls, money, weapons,
rings, belts ?????, ( This one seems to have a bit more to it than
most ) wands, first aid kits, bandages, armour, keys etc.
    The graphics are erm...  functional ( reviewerese for  crap  )
your  character  looks  as  though he has a  hernia  and  has  the
greatest  difficulty in walking,  he seems to  hop.  The  monsters
consist  of  blocks with smiling faces or yorkshire  terriors  who
also have hernias. It can be very hard to tell whats what and even
harder to pick it up and use it. This is due to the strange (  and
very awkward to use ) mixture of keyboard and  joystick  used  and
the fact that some things such as the  arrows  don't  seem  to  do
anything.
   Despite these critiscims it can be quite fun to play and if  it
wasn't so hard I might actually have enjoyed it.

what  the proper word is but can't quite peel it off  the  tip  of

Game: Harfe
Author: Andreas Bewersdorff
Type: Freeware
Res: Any ( Depends on the type of cards you use.)

Review:
       The most common type of game in the public domain are  card
games.  Many theories have been postulated ( Good word huh  ?  But
not as long as pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcaniconiosis. That
should  really confuse the word rap !  ) to explain this  and  the
most  popular is that card games require no imagination  to  write
and it is a well known fact that anyone who uses a computer has no
imagination and is completly brain dead QED ( bit of sarcasm there
).  This is one of those card games.  It is a patience variant and
is  all in German which can be a bit of a problem ( I  didn't  pay
attention  in  the German lessons either ).  There is  an  english
instruction file but it is called HARFE.ENG and it took me a  long
time to realise that it was a doc file. These instructions are not
that  good and mostly tell you about the card designer which is  a
great  extra.  Therefore  here are a few tips,  the cards  in  the
bottom  left corner can be put onto one of the strips of cards  by
double  clicking  on them.  They are atomatically  placed  on  the
correct  pile.  Pressing the right mouse button changes the  card.
Apart from this it is the same rules as for a comman patience game
whose  name  eludes  me  for  the  moment  but  according  to  the
instructions is called the harp.  This could explain why the  game
is called Harfe ( the german for guess what ? ).

Game: Milestone
Author: David Addison
Type: Freeware
Res: Low

Review:
        This is quite a hard game to describe,  therefore I  shall
describe it ( I like a challenge ). It is a card game without  any
cards ( see, I told you it was hard to describe ). The idea of the
game is to score  1000 miles before your opponent does. To do this
your vehicle must work and  you  must  be  able  to  travel.  Your
opponent is trying to  stop you so that he can clock up the milage
before you do. This is done by playing sentances such as flat tyre
or accident.  You must play countering  cards  to start again such
as spare tyre  or repairs. This is quite fun despite being hard to
explain. It doesn't really have any graphics but is well  set  out
and colourful.

Game: Tennis
Authors: Bruno Duriez, Albert Loridan and Joel Sana
Type: Freeware
Res: Med

Review:
       For public domain software this is just amazing. Excellent
movement and graphics,  great gameplay and a lot of options at the
front end.  Why can't all PD software be like this ( Cliche number
3)  ?  There are no instructions but it is just a fairly  straight
forward tennis game and doesn't really need any.  It can be  quite
hard  when playing the computer but that is probably because I  am
incapable  of  playing tennis of any sort.  What else can  I  say,
Great ( Cliche number 4 ).

Game: Royale
Author: Michael Nowicki  ( where do they get these names ? )
Type: Freeware
Res: Med.

Review:
        This  is another of those PD card games but  unlike  Harfe
this   is  a  pointless  waste  of  time.   It  claims  to  be   a
representation  of poker but there is no way to play anyone  else.
All that happens is that you bet one to five coins and then win  a
set  amount depending on your hand.  For instance 5 coins for  two
pairs or 500 coins for a royal flush. You start with 100 coins and
it is almost impossible to lose any money at all.  One royal flush
and  you'll  be  playing until doomsday ( except  you'll  die  of
boredom long before that ).

Graphics: 54%
Gameplay: 17%
Lastibility: 2%  ( You won't even finish one game. )
Overall: 15%
