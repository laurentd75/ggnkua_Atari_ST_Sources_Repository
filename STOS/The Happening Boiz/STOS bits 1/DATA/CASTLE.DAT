CASTLE MASTER by INCENTIVE 
 (Published by DoMark, œ19.99).

 It's been one-and-a-half years since Total Eclipse, the last 
Freescape game. Since then I've upgraded to the 16-bit ST from a 
humble Speccy and the new Freescaper, Castle Master, has now been 
moved to the new technology too. For me, used to the small-world, 
monochrome Dark Side, Castle Master is a shock. 16 colours! A 
huge area! Fast responses! Ditching of the SF ethic!

 Yes, Castle Master is a deep-seated fantasy game. Guess the 
storyline. Done that? Yup, it's a rescue the Princess (or Prince 
if you must) from the depths of the castle in which they are 
trapped. No awards for originality there! So, after the loading 
and a short animated sequence, you come to be standing outside 
the castle. Running (selected from the windows on the left-hand 
side of the screen or a menu from clicking the CASTLE MASTER 
bar), you circle round the castle; and it looks big! A small hut 
is worth a going over, with the crawl and look options needed to 
search every corner. Going back to the drawbridge and taking the 
plaque in the hut's advice (whaddaya mean, you didn't read it?) 
you enter the castle. Looking up, you observe there is more than 
one level. Mmmm. This isn't going to be as easy as those 8-bit 
games....

 Now is the time to get used to the menu fuctions, which are 
actually quite easy to use. Going round, you can select (with the 
mouse) to run, walk, crawl, look up or down, move around (as an 
alternative to a joystick) see how strong you are, look at the 
number of keys, and check your score. Clicking on the last meter, 
you can see how many spirits you've killed.

 Ah yes, spirits. Whereas the other Freescapes were 'dead,' the 
Castle has ghosts. YOu have to have your hands on the mouse each 
timwe you enter a room in order to zap them (with rocks, fired by 
the left mouse button) and stop them draining you energy.
 Strength. Another good point. You start Healthy, can drop to 
Feeble, but it's much more desirable to be Hurculean. (I always 
knew I could get to be Mr Universe on one computer game or 
another!) Cheese appears to be your Prince(sses) favourite food, 
as eating (by pointing and clicking with the right mouse button) 
the specimens littered around the Castle seems to give your 
energy a nice boost. (Kippers work even greater wonders!)

  Managing to get to the second level, things get much harder. 
Your way is getting blocked much more often. Mind you, the second 
level is easy compared to the evil complexities of level 4! With 
the new scale of the game, you can't trust every room to have an 
object, but on the other hand, oyu can't take the chance. Even 
the toilet (yes, really!), gym, pottery, football pitch and wine 
cellar need careful examination

 In all, for those with 3.5 brain cells (Gazza, take a bow! 
Sorry, had to get it in!) don't bother. But if you can get on 
with the puzzles, it is well worth the money. Even previous 
Freescape-auts would find it a worthwhile experience.

HINTS'N'TIPS:
               Aim to remove the padlocks.
               Igor seems to live in the kitchen.
               To get a flying start, fire twice.
               What did there used to be next to kitchens?
               Don't relax in the solarium!
               The pottery makes time (or you?) fly; if you can 
                get in!
               Check each side of a door: you may find something 
                useful.
