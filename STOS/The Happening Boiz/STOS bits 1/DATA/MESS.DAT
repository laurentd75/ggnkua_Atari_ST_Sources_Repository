This routine is a newish one, it is based on a piece of code from 
an old copy of ST User. What is does is display text messages by 
scrolling  a line of text along the bottom of the screen, it then 
shifts the whole screen up, then scrolls the next line of text 
on, so you get a 'credits' type effect. At the moment the routine 
uses the standard STOS font,but you could easily adapt it to use 
the Xenon 2 font, or one of your own fonts, a good idea would be 
to get rid of the flicker when the screen scrolls up.
 Here is a quick break down of the routine....

Right, the program sets up two screens, it then prints out all 
the text to one screen, it then SCREEN COPIES a bit of that 
screen onto the physical screen, whn the whole line has been 
scrolled, the program calls a subroutine that then scrolls the 
whole screen up, then the programs carries on, when it runs out 
of text it loops back to the beginning.

This routine is based around the SCREEN COPY command, and the 
little known fact that you can achieve pixel horizontal 
scrolling, this is because SCREEN COPY ONLY rounds the 
destination X co-ord to the nearest 16 pixel boundary, the 
rectangle you actually cut out can be anything as long as the 
'distance' between x1 and x2 is a multple of 16. STudy the 
syntax.

 SCREEN COPY scr1,x1,y1,x2,y2 TO scr2,x3,y3

x1, and x2 can be anything, but x3 WILL be rounded to the nearest 
16 bit boundary.Okay....

Well, happy scrolling.
