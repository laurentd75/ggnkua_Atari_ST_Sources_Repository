Dear ST'er,

Thank you for your interest in the TRuST P.D. Library.

On this disk are details of some of the best P.D. and SHAREWARE
available for the ST/E.

All disks are single sided unless stated otherwise.

1MEG  These programs required one megabyte of RAM to run.

MONO  These require High Res Mono Monitor.  N.B. Some will work
      with Mono Emulator, available on UTL 16.

STE   Programs marked "Not STE" are not STE compatible. Sounds
      obvious eh?
