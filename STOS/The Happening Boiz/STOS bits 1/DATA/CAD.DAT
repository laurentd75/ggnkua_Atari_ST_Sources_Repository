This just has to be one of the best games ever written, it is 
bloody awesome. the game is an iso metric arcade adventure on a 
huge scale, with hundreds of rooms to explore, loads of objects 
to play with, monsters, and puzzles that will keep you up all 
night (well I stayed up!!).
 The game comes on two disks, and retails at œ24.95 ( but I got 
my copy for $15 at the 16-bit show so there!).

This is how it goes........

insert disk 1 into drive

sit in awe as you hear some of the most classy music ever, 4 
track quartet music.

Now the idea of the game

You play the role of Karadoc, the fearless dwarf, whos lust for 
adventure is alot less than his lust for money/treasure/fame 
etc,etc. You enter Castle Wulf in search of Dianos the evil 
necromancer, and more importantly in search of treasure.

Control of Karaoc is via the joystick, which gets some getting 
used to, but when you get it, you can run round the rooms like 
nobody's business.

You can interact with most objects, the interaction is via 
control icons that appear when you touch an object, these icons 
are tailored to each object so you can'y eat a barrel, or wear a 
dead rat on you head.
 The icons allow you to eat,throw,pull,pickup,drop,open, close, 
and many,many more
 
now for some scores.....

graphics:   99% they are brilliant!

Sound:      60% very atmospheric, but too sparse.

Game play:  100% my best game!

Lasting appeal: 80% you may get put off when you get stuck.

Overall:    99% every body should buy it.}
