Okay boys and girls, Eddie here once again to speak about a certain 
demo that was given to me the other day, the demo whcih I speak of is 
The Decade Demo By The Inner Circle, and to be quite honest it is a 
load a bollocks, in fact its the worst demo I have ever seen, I reckon 
this bloke called Count Fucking Zero and his friend Griff the shithead 
are the worst demo coders alive, and to say that their vector graphics 
are the faster ever on the ST is a load of old shit!, for a start they 
are not solid and they also only occupy part of the ST's screen.
 Any body who has this demo should burn it, and get a decent demo like 
the MindBomb demo from The Lost Boys, who really know how to code 
demos, and fro calling TLB a bunch of code rippers is distugusting, 
and Griff, if you ever read this, all I can say is that I would be so 
embarrassed if someone suggested that I had used your shit 3D balls 
code, don't you know that coping is the greatest form of flattery, and 
talking of ripping code, havn't I seen that Megadeth font before? so 
go back to dream land mate!!!!
 You proberbly think that I hate The inner circle, not really I'm just 
giving them some of their own medicine, if you are ever unfortunate 
enough to find a copy of this demo(look in the PD catalogues under  
the AMAZINGLY SHIT DEMOS BY A BUNCH OF ARSEHOLES section.), some of 
the screens are actually quite good but nothing to write home about.
 Talking about The Lost Boys, I have been informed that the lads are 
busy coding away on their latest demo which is going to be called the 
LIFE IS A BITCH Demo and should be out soon(????) from Budgie UK.

 Well thats all for now, and remember The Inner Circle are a bunch of 
Leather-Loving, Bum-pushing, ARSE BANDITS.
