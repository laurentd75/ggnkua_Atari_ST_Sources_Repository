Eddie has done it at last, the first ever HORIZONTAL WOBBLER, written 
in STOS, yes its true,using the facts about the SCREEN COPY 
command (read the article on the message code), I have been able 
to code a sine wave wobbler that wobbles horizontally, until now 
this has been impossible because STOS rounds down the destination 
X co-ords to the nearest 16 bit boundary.
 This is how it works:

First of all a sine table is created using.
 DIM Y(730)
 FOR K=1 TO 720
     ANGLE#=RAD(K)
     Y(K)=100+SIN(ANGLE#)*30
 NEXT K

The routine then grabs 3 scan lines at a time from to source 
picture, at x X co-ords of y(??) and displays then on the 
physical screen at 0,0+Scanlines, as ?? increases so the picture 
flows back and forth across the screen. Not bad eh????
