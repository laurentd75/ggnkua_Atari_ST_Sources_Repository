Merry Christmas to you all... From everybody at THB HQ.
 This is the last text file I am  going  to write for STOS BITS, it is
the 23rd of December 1990,  and  I  am  posting  this  disc to Camy at
Budgie uk this afternoon, I  know  its  a  bit late for Christmas, but
thats life isn't it.
 This article is about DEMO CHEATS, so lets get on with it......

DISC MAGGIE V1.0 - The Lost Boys.

 To find the hidden article you  must  click  on  the left disc on the
menu screen with both  mouse  buttons,  you  will  then  be asked some
simple questions, ( AND comes in between day and night !)
 The hidden article is all about  song  lyrics by a particular band..I
can't remember the name !!

MindBomb demo - The Lost Boys.

To get to the vector screen you  have  to climb the ladder to the left
of the door, and move right when  you  are near the top of the ladder,
you should then fall through the wall, and there you are.Easy when you
know how.

The Giant Demo - The Cool Carrot.

Stop looking, there isn't one, I don't  think  TCC put one in, any way
if the hidden screen is as 'good'  as  the rest of the demo, you won't
want to find it (Sorry Paul, had to get it in !)

I can't think of any other demos...........

Not musch of an article eh??

Oh yes by the way if anybody wants an exculsive THB t-shirt, just send
œ5.00 to me at our address,  the  shirts  are really very good, I have
already sold 5, and the people who brought them think they are great!!

And how about another plea  for  help  -  I  need anybody who would be
intrested in designing levels for  Dizzy  Lizzy  -  I hope to keep ol'
Dizzy going, but to do so I need loads and loads of new levels, if you
are intrested then contact me..

Well better go and play test FunTime for an hour....

I hope you had a merry christmas, and a happy new year....

Bye
