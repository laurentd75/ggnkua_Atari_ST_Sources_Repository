
 THE COOL CARROT DIY JACUZZI ARTICLE!

  To make your own jacuzzi is very simple. I hope you will be 
able to join in!
  First, buy a circular bath. Check and see if it has some 
fixings on the underside. If not, throw it away and buy another 
one. Then buy a 2CV and rip out the suspension. If you don't want 
something as cheap buy one of the old Slinky toys- you know, the 
ones that walk down stairs on their own? Oh. Get the spring out 
of a biro then.
 Right. Now weld the suspension (now out of the car, wheel, axle 
et al, I hope....)/Slinky/Biro spring to the underneath of the 
bath. Done that? Good. Plumb in the bath to the watermains with 
rubber tubing and make sure the Sellotape is fixed well.
 The clever bit! Fix the springs to the floor (a concrete floor 
is handy here, as is a ton of ReadyMix) and fill up the bath with 
water. Get into the bath (do you need to be told how?) and wait.
 Oh, sorry. I forgot. get a tin of baked beans (Jumbo size if 
possible) and open it. Put a Primus stove under it and heat. Use 
any spare rubber tubing to suck up the beans. Now, any botty 
thunder will be magnified by the suspension/Slinky/Biro springs 
and the bath will move, and the bubbles will generate the right 
atmosphere.
 (An extractor fan is also handy).
 If you need any help, the men in white coats- no, not now, I'm 
writing- argggh, put me down. I'm not mad, just ask that passing 
man with fifteen heads and an elderburry bush in his pocket! 
Arrgh! I'm an important programmer! Go away!
 (Fade to silence. Rumble of new person sitting in leather chair 
with slightly better attitude to life, the universe and everything).
 Sorry about that, I'm better now. Where was I? Oh yes, I've got 
to write another article for Eddie (on pain of losing my 
exclusive THB T-shirt) and the Bits magazine. Well, try looking 
for it then!
