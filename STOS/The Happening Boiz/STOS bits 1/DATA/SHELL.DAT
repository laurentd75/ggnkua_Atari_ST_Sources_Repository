Hi, I haven't written anything for this  magazine for a while, but I'm
back now (cheer, cheer!), I would  like  to  say a few words about the
first game shell we are about to release.
 This shell is for a simple platform game, where you can move a little
man around hundreds of locations.The files you need to use are called:

 GAME.BAS
 MAPED.BAS
 MONED.BAS

GAME.BAS is the actual shell, where  you  can use the joystick to move
the little trapdoor bloke around using the joystick.
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT!!

 MAP DATA IS STORED IN BANK 10, AND MONSTER DATA IS STORED IN BANK 9

So when you have finished editing a  map using MAPED.BAS you must copy
the contents of bank 10 into  bank  10  in GAME.BAS, follow? good, and
the same goes for MONED.BAS, you must  copy  the contents of bank 9 to
bank 9 in GAME.BAS so you can see the whole thing together.

Controls for MAPED.BAS:
Note - the keyboard must be in UPPER case

A and Z move up and down 1 room
, and . move left and right 1 room

Use the  joystick  to  position  the  current  building  block  on the
screen,ocnfirm with the fire button

+ and - scroll through the building blocks

Controls for MONED.BAS

A and Z move up and down 1 room
, and . move left and right 1 room

joystick to position sprite

+ and - cycle through sprites.

note - Any sprite can be used  as  a  monster, but when the monster is
animated( such as the EYE  in  this  version.),  you must position the
FIRST frame of animation.
 When you press fire you will be  asked  for  the SPEED, X STEP, AND Y
STEP, these control the movement of your monster

Using this system you should be  able to create some stunning results,
why not try some of the following.

Making monster interactive with the player.
Create awesome puzzles.
add NEW graphics.
Standing on your head whilst eating a chocolate eclare and singing
the star spangled banner.

If you do get some where with  these sources, please, please send them
to me 'cos I would like to see them.
