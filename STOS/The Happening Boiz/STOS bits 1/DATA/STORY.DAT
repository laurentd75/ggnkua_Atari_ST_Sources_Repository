room during a free lesson, we don't know who wrote it, and because
its so stupid the person who did write it will never own up.

Short Story.



One day I went to the post office and my mother was sitting waiting
for ages. She wnet to the till and then found out that the one she
had been quing at was closed for 2 hours. She finally got to the que
where the till was open she complained to the manager and got
$200,000,000 as a refound to her 1 minute wait. The bank manager was
getting into his car as we was on the way home. As we was walking
down the street the bank manager run me over. I was dragged along the
road for about 50 miles by then I was getting a bit tired. About
another 10 miles down the road we came to some red lights. When we
started again my leg fell off. after another 200m 1 eyeball and a
willy fell off..

the text above, and whoever wrote it is a silly prat!
