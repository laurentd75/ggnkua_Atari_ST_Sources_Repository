Bouncy Bars by ah-YEAH

Hello, how are you?    thats good, the Bouncy bar source is 
actually called BAR.BAS and as usual it can be found in the DATA 
folder, let me just run through it

first of all a sine table is generated, in the B# array
then logic is set to back so you can't see the screen being 
drawn, now comes the main loop, the loop runs from 1 to 360 in 
steps of 10 ( or is it 5 ?)
every tim ethis loop is run 5 bars are draw using the following 
code.

for v=1 to 5
screen copy 15,0,0,320,10 to logic,0,b#(k+(v*10))
next v

k is the counter for the main loop (1 to 360)
the screen that is copied is a strip of screen from bank 15 that 
is 320 by 10 pixels deep ( I used colour bars, but these no 
reason why you couldn't use something else.)
