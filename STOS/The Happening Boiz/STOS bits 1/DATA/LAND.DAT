Huuuuh?????, I thought this was a STOS magazine, Arrrg what the 
heck, I might as well include some GFA stuff, this source was 
written by Adam Medley, of Super League Soccer fame (???). and to 
be honest it's quite good, what it does is animate a scrolling 
landscape, the source is fully documented so I don't have to talk 
about it much, but I must say that it has to run in LOW RES, 
otherwise it just locks up!.
 Some news...Adam is working on a new game, called Drop Zone, and 
its coming along, but still needs alot of work, his progress has 
been hamped due to the fact that he lost half is entire disc 
collection the other day for no known reason, wierd huh ??
