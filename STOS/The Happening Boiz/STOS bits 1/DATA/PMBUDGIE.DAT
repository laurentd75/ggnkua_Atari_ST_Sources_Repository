MindBomb, Genesys.
 (2 Demos, Published By Budgie)

 Firstly, a demo likely to become as famous as the Union. It's 
the Lost Boys MindBomb Demo (sorry, I don't know its 
number). Steve Delaney (he of FloppyShop fame) said of the 
Lost Boys Definitive demo, "Is  this the British challenge to 
the Union Demo? Perhaps not but it must rank very close." Well, 
MindBomb blows Union out of the disk drive! The best part of 
MindBomb (the Red Sector 3D demo) was running on at least 4 
of the stands at Atari's June show, and I suspect selling like 
hot cakes. It also has a four-track sample player, with four 
tunes composed by the Boys themselves (Return Of The Mutant Wafer
Biscuits, I ask you!) and two P.S.B (Pet Shop Boys: wake up, 
guys!) tunes (including the classic In The Night, theme tune to 
the Clothes Show). Other good bits include the SWUS demo, 
featuring a classic wait message. In fact, without two computers 
(one to run the program, one to type in a review) it is 
impossible to do it justice. The only way to see it all is to buy
the thing, and I strongly recommend that! One word of warning: it
is almost impossible to copy.
 Lastly, Genesys by Aenigmatica. Released through Budgie, like 
MindBomb, in April, I felt disappointed by it. With only 6 
screens it felt far too small, and none of it was stunningly 
original. Even the sample player seemed boring and old-hat, 
although it did have a screen to stop you getting bored while it 
was loading. (I have an idea to revolutionise them, but it's a 
secret. You'll know it if you see it!) Best bits were the text-
scroller with huge text (which was smoother around the edges than
its competitors) and the first screen with what looked to me like
three singing Neil Kinnocks! Whether or not this was intentional
or not is a very moot point. (Aenigmatica are, I think, Germans 
like TEX, and so wouldn't know Kinnock. Proof: their messages 
aren't perfect, plus the stupid name. Well, I think so, anyway!) 
If you haven't got a recent machine-code demo you may like this, 
as it is very competently programmed. But these days (as I've 
found out!) you need something new to break into the ST demo market, 
and this doesn't supply it. For Aenigmatica to become a real house- 
hold name, they'll have to do a bit (not much, though) better.

 The Cool Carrot, 26/10/90. (Sorry if it's not long enough, 
            Eddie, but you should know English is my weak point!)
