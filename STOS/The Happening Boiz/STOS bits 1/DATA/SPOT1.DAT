This is another short routine that serves no real purpose, all it does
is display a 'search light', to put it simply a circular area of screen
is shown at a time, this area of screen bounces up and down using a sine wave
and so you get to see the whole picture like if you were in a dark room
shining a torch at the wall ( Did you follow that??).

By the way we (THB) have start to do some pointless coding, oops I mean
a demo, the demo will be written in STOS and GFA and so far features:
 
The fastest vector graphics ever written in STOS
The worlds biggest scroller (80 pixels deep !!!)
The first vector scroll (ever seen the red sector demo on the Amiga games
 machine.).basically it is a scrolline that is contructed using vectors so
you can wrap it round in a circle !!!

Also featured..if they work correctly:
 
A Soundtracker screen (yes that bloddy games machine again!)
A digi-screen with a sampled sound track and some nifty digi graphics.

Well must go now................Yeah 1711991..........
