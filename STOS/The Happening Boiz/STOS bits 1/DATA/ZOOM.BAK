This is another little routine that has no real use to me at the 
moment, but then again I will proberly (sic) use it sometime, all 
it does is take a string and zoom up each letter of the string 
one by one, the effect generated is similar to that used in Xenon 
2, where the credits are zoomed in and out.
 To inprove the routine you could make it zoom the text back out 
agin, if you do this please send a copy to me....
