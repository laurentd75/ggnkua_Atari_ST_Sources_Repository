Over the past few months we have been overloaded with work, doing Budgie 
work, educational software for ESP Software, as well as this.Bits 
should be finished very soon, along with the educational package.
 Dizzy Lizzy 2 is already in the pipe line, and I have already 
made a start on the new graphixs, DL 2 is not just going to be a 
restyled DL1, no way Sir Robin Day, its going to feature loads of 
new ideas such as:

 Screen Wobbles - Well IMPRESSIVE !!!
 Chose-a-tune   - Various Christmassy tunes for you to chose from
 BIGGER high score table - Yes its true at least 500 names !!
 New BLOCKS - like BONUS blocks, RIP signs, etc ,etc
 2 player option - Very good idea
 Level EDITOR - At last you can edit you own screens.

Dizzy Lizzy 2 "A winters tale" should be out mid November.

I doudt STOS BITS will be that regular, unless you all send me 
you fave routines written in STOS, 'cos thats what this mag is 
all about SSSTTTOOOOSSSS.

Bret The Barbarik:
 This is my latest creation, at the moment it is only designed on 
paper, because we just haven't time to code it right now, all I 
can say is it is going to be our best game so far, and is going 
to feature the best platform action EVER !!!

Demo will be available as soon as I have written one.

Fun Time:
 This is our first package released by ESP Software, it is a 
educational package for children who have just started school.The 
software is based round good old Dizzy and includes:

     Picture Fun - Improve spelling, memory, and loads of other 
     things, using picture picture-words association.

     Clock Fun - Easy to use, time telling program.

     Money Fun - Introduces children to counting with English 
     coins.

     Paint - A simple to use painting package which features line 
     drawing, fill, circle, etc, etc.

     Seasons - Watch each scene which depics each of the four 
     seasons, all with their own sound effects.

     Mouse and Key Fun - Too many educational packages requires 
     the child to use the computer mouse and keyboard to use the 
     programs, so we have included a couple of 'games' that 
     introduce to child to the computer.

We have done some other things but I get bored writing about 
work.

Working with ESP has allowed us to use Amigas (traitor, traitor 
!!), and as a result, our previous Budgie releases should be out 
on the Amiga soon !!!

Well thats what happening at the mo' until next time..........
