Hello and welcome to the first collection of TIPS for coding in
STOS.I know alot of you proberbly look at demos like the mindbomb demo
or the genesys demos and wish you were able to create the effects
used in those demos....well by using STOS you can almost achieve
this, of course the results aren't as good as thos done using 68000
but are still very effective !!!.Fisrtly I will show you how create
RASTERS!, these are those nifty colour bars that move up and down the
screen, using the horizontal blank interupt (timer B) you can change
the actual colour of any colour register(0-15 in low resolution.),if
you change the colours fast enough you can have as many colours on
screen at once.

 By DOKING (Oh erh !) $FF8240 with $777 will cause the back ground
colour to change to white , this will only be visable if the colour
wasn't white to start with, by doking $700 the background becomes
red.

 $FF8240 is colour register 0 $FF8242 is the next and so on, but
remember we are working in HEX so you need to use letters, no need to
write down all the addresses as it won't take long for you to find
them and it will be a sort of task for you to peform.

 And now for a little bit about horizontal blanks......Every 1/50th
of a second the picture on your tv/monitor you are watching is
redrawn by an electron gun which starts at the top left of the screen
and scans left to right until it reaches the bottom, then it returns
to the top and does it again( It must get very bored, its proberbly
like doing Maths homework!!),If you can track the electron beam as it
zips around the screen you can change the colour it is drawing, do
you follow?

 It must be said that to keep track of the beam takes almost all of
STOS's time so try and do too musch only results in a scambling of
colours and could cause a mega crash !!!

 The following piece of code demonstrates rasters, it produces 3
colour bars that move up and down the screen, behind a picture, which
reminds me for the code to work you need to place a suitable screen
in menory bank 15...Well bye and happy rasters!!!!!!!!

1 hide
2 curs off : key off
3 F=7 : S=1
4 get palette (15)
5 screen copy 15 to physic
6 auto back off
10 wait vbl
20 for I=1 to F : next I

Well how about this then??
the date is now 21 December 1990- and I (Eddie) am going through
all the text files adding a tag character  to the end of each file.
