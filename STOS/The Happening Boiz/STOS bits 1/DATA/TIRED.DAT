Here is a short passage........................

"I'm tired."

Yes, I'm tired. For several years now I've been
blaming it on middle age, porr blood, lack of
vitamins, air pollution, saccharin, odesity,
dieting, under arm odour, additives and a dozen
other maladies that make you wonder is life really
is worth living!
 But I found out that it isn't that - I'm tired
because I'm overworked.
 The population of this country is 51 million.
21 million are retired.
That leaves 30 million to do the work.
There are 19 million at school.
That leaves 11 million to do the work.
2 million are unemployed and 4 million are employed
by the goverment.
That leaves 5 million to do the work.
1 million are in the armed forces whixh leaves 4 million
to do the work.
3 million are employed by County and Borough Councils
leaving 1 million to do the work.
There are 620,000 people in hospital and 379,998 people
in prisions.

Which leaves 2 people to do all the work.

You and me.

And you're sitting on your arse reading this.

So no wonder I'm tired !!!!!!
