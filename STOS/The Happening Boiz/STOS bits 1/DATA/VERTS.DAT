Welcome brothers and sisters to another interesting STOS session with
Eddie, this time its SCROLLING using BLOCKS.
 By using the SCREEN$ command you can easily paste sprites onto
the screen, this is a lot faster than having to do the
following:-
SPRITE 1,X,y,I
REDRAW
PUT SPRITE 1

to set up the BLOCKS, you have to first plot the sprite to the
screen, then grab that image data into a SCREEN STRING (SCREEN$),
like this:-

SPRITE 1,0,0,1
REDRAW
BL$=SCREEN$(BACK,0,0 TO 16,16)

Remember that the SCREEN$ command works on 16-bit boundaries

For this routine, all the blocks are 16*16 pixels.

The rountine first cuts out the screen blocks, then draws the
first screen, once that is done the computer waits for an input
from the joystick. If the joystick is pulled down then the
program jumps to a subroutine that scrolls the screen up one ROW.
 If the joystick is pushed up then a subroutine scrolls the
screen down 16 pixels and redraws the top ROW.Using this
technique you can create vast playing fields using a few simple
building blocks.

To change the map provided you need to use the MAP EDITOR
supplied with STOS Basic (even though its crap!!!)

Use 16*16 pixel sprites, unless you alter the code, in which case
use any size sprites you like.

The screen data is stored at line 600 onwards, so when you have
designed your map, save it as and ascii file, then reload it
into STOS and delete lines 50000-50003 (very important!!), then
renumber to 600, then copy the new map data into the program
(understand that, no didn't think you would!)

Thats all for now, so till next time bye........
