Hi and welcome to SPOT 2 another spot light routine, even more pointless
than the first..is seen in Lifes a bitch demo by The Lost Boys this spot
light moves back and forth across the screen, but unlike the bouncing up and
down one, this one doesn't show a picture in the light, but theres no 
reason why it shouldn't, so get working you programmers you!

now some more infomation:

It is now January 25 1991, and T.C.C is round, he has shown me his latest
demo (???), which basically shows that he is totally obsessed with
Star Trek (sad git!), he reckons that he will soon be a Happening Boi, but
we (Eddie,Ian, and Gofer) have sworn never to allow anyone to join the 
hipest crew alive.
 I failed to get into Ipswich Art College ( Bastards), they said my 
portfolio was great, and I showed a high level of competence for a 'A' level
student, but my work was too graphical, and that a art course wouldn't suit
me, so I have to arrange some more inteviews!
