I don't know about you, but I find that the fades available 
through STOS are a bit boring so I sat down this evening and 
coded some of my own, so far I have done:

     A BLIND fade, that simply fades in the screen like a blind
     being closed, if you see what I mean.

     A VERTICAL SLIDE fade which scrolls a thin strip of screen 
     down the display.

     BLOCK SLIDE is similar to vertical slide, except that it 
     slides down rectangular section of the stored picture on the 
     physical screen.

These simple fades can be used to bring your games to life (Crap 
!!), use them to fade between highscore tables and menu screens, 
etc,etc....

Some late news just coming in.......

The is also a ZOOM1.BAS source code which is the same as 
ZOOM.BAS, but has a starfield and raters and looks so brilliant.
