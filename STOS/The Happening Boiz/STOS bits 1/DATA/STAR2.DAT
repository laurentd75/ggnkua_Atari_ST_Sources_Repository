Well, he's back with ANOTHER routine, this one is another STAR FIELD, 
but its not horizontal, not even vertical, it is in fact 3 
dimensional!!!, it was written using my vector grpahics shell 
routine, and plots 81 stars, that mov in fromt the distance, and 
appear to fly past you, to be honest with you its not as good as 
I had hoped, but I'm getting there (slowly!), I would rather call 
it my star stream.
 The only real problem is that the field contains 81 stars, and 
100 frames, and so the source HAS to be compiled to run at any 
speed, and also the frames take a hell of a long time to be 
calculated (this coould be cured by calculating the points once, 
and storing the resulting data in a memory bank, so get coding!)
 I don't really want to get into how the points are calculated, 
'cos it is so boring just sitting on my arse typing, when I could 
be strumming, or working on our next game (which contradicts NEXT 
RELEASE somewhat, it seems our next game will be a cocktail of 
Dungeon master and Cadaver - ie set in a dungeon with arcade 
action hot enough to fry an egg, and an atmosphere thicker than 
monkey shit!).
