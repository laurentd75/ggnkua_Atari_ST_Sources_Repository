Hi..I just want to say that I have put another raster source code in
the PROGRAMM folder, this routine displays a nice rainbow type
effect all the way down the screen, applications for such and
effect are few and far between, but it does make dull statics
picture more interesting, such as high score tables and info
screens that don't require loads of processor time to move
sprites around.
 The source code is called RAST2.BAS. Okay.

EB20101990 Yeah........

I'm back, the date is 28 January 1991, and i must tell you about 
another raster routine I have put on the disk - called raster3.bas.
this is more clever than the others, because it is cycling, ie the 
colours spin round and round, the only problem is that it takes almost 
a whole vbl to do
so theres not any time for sprites etc, put as I said above, this 
type of routine is great for static screens, for instant, when I was 
coding this routine
I had a screen in memory that had lots of fonts on, and I had the 
raster in colour index 1,($ff8242), so the colour of the font was
 constantly cycling!!

The cycling is done by placing the RGB value of the colours 
required into a array, from this array you can call the RGB value 
into the address of the required colour index thus producing a 
coloured bar. The whole colour array can then be shifted one 
place along using the SWAP command, and the end value is copied 
to first like this:

dim col(30) : set up array of 30 colours.
.
.
.
.
for k=1 to 30
swap col(k),col(k+1) : shift colour table.
col(30)=col(1)
next k
.
.
to see it in action boot up STOS and load RASTER.BAS
and compile the source.
 You will notice that moving the mouse will interupt the rasters, 
to stop this you need to compile with compiler checks OFF, this 
helps but you still get the odd jerk.
