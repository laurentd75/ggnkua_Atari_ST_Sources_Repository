The time: 18:56:33 on Jan 25 1991, Roundtable is on on Radio 1 
and in about twenty five minutes I am going to go and watch 
A.W.O.L starring Jean Claude Van Damme, I've just about got 
time to start this article for the THB's disc mag STOS Bits.

Six months ago Eddie (from the THB's) agreed to draw some 
graphics for a program I was writing called 'Early Learning 
Maths' on condition that I gave  him some routines for his disc 
mag. Well I got my graphics five and a half months ago and due 
to unforseen circumstances ( an operation, an AMIGA, a broken 
ST, and several assignments ) Eddie did not recieve his 
routines. Until now that is. I got my ST back from the computer 
doctors yesterday and am in the process of compiling some 
routines.

  ( ASIDE: Pet hate number 72, ST repair companies. When my ST
    died I took it along to a local repair company who promptly
    decided that I needed a new power supply unit. Cost, about 
    œ100. Unable to afford this I gave my computer to a 
    technician here at Keele University, who repaired it in 24 
    hours at a cost of œ18, œ14 for parts and œ4 for labour.
    My ST didn't need a new PSU. Conclude what you will !!!!! )

Anyway, back to the routines. I have written two short 
programs. The first is inspired by Eddie's article on rasters 
in STOS ( STOS Bits issue 1 ) and is relatively simple, but 
looks quite good. The second is a program which demonstrates 
several routines: a menu shell, a keyboard/mouse input routine, 
and several 'appear' routines.


        .... 7.23 gotta go, I'll be back in about three hours,
  maybe I'll tell you what the film was like, maybe not ....


        .... 7.25 Oops, forgot my ticket 0....................


        ....11.04 crap film, now shall I watch THE WORD or 
  continue typing this shitty text file? No contest, see you in
  fifty four minutes ........................................


        .... 12.04, 28/1/91, So it's taken me two and a half 
  days to get back to this, who cares?


Where was I? Right, describing the routines to you.

The raster routine is very simple, but includes moving rasters. 
The actual routine to do the rasters is line 80 onwards and 
works by waiting for a VBL and then changing the background 
colour as quickly as possible. By the way, don't compile it ( 
timing gets a little fucked up, and you get a REALLY messy 
display!! ).

I think all the routines in the other program are fairly well 
documented so I will not say anything else about them. ( Except 
that you move the menu bar with the cursor keys, and select an 
option by pressing return. ) One other thing here are some line 
numbers for you:
  1-200 : main program
  4000-4999 ; appear routines
  5000-6000 : menu shell
  10000-10100 : mouse/keyboard input routine

That's all you are getting, goodbye ... for ever (possibly).

The two sources are called RASTER4 and MENU and can be found in 
the PROGRAMM folder.
