How come I write everything, well hello and welcome ( I always say 
that, and it sounds so stupid!), I know we saad this is a STOS 
magazine, but we thought we would include some 68000 stuff as 
well, I am going to talk about my 'more colours than yours' demo 
screen that I wrote around June time (1990), this screen was put 
together using routines from Budgies 68000 shell, and Moving 
Bytes, by mixing the various routines is was able to create the 
desired screen, The source code for this demo is in the PROGRAMM 
folder, and can be changed to your hearts content ( as long as 
you have Devpac 2 !!), even if you don't have the assembler, you 
can still run the demo.
 For any body considering learning 68000, or someone who knows a 
little and would like to further their knowledge Budgie have some 
of the best 68000 stuff around...
 A frequently update 68000 shell: which is packed with 
sprite,picture,music,high scores, and hundreds more routines.
 Moving Bytes: more routines,scrollines,music, etc, etc
 Sounds of the Shapeshifter: brings you the music of the best ST 
musician alive GOTH, loads of songs and loads of source codes.

Well thats it folks.......
