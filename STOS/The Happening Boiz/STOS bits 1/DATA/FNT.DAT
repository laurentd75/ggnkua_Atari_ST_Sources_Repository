STOS FONTS:

 In the Data folder, or is it the Program folder, there is a data file
called X2.mbk, or something  like  that,  this  file  is the font from
Xenon 2, all the letters are sprites,  so  you can use them in you own
games, but remember that someone  else  drew  them  ,  and so they are
copyright Imageworks, but I thought I would include them anyway.
 I used them in the original bits magazine that I wrote in STOS, every
time you ran one of the  small  demo  screens you got a wobbly message
using the Xenon 2 font and  the  wobble  routine that are both on this
disc.

If you have any really good  fonts  that  you would like to share with
other STOS users please send them to me.
