AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
 Why can't people do as they are asked!!!!!!
 I mustn't moan or Ian will proberbly hit me, but when doing stuff 
for this wicked disc mag, I wish those concerned would write me a 
text file to accompany the source code.

If anybody sends me any sources can they please document the 
source  and include a short text file that explains the source (and also any 
stories/articles !!)

The source for the worlds first STOS VECTOR SCROLLINE

Basically what it does is take a text string and bend it round in 
a circle using vectors, its similar to the red sector demo off 
the Amiga games machine, and the vector demo from Life's a 
bitch( available from Budgie!!), its not as good is those but its 
very nifty, and Ian Chapmans best bit of coding ever (and thats 
saying something!!!!!!!)

so load and prepare to be amazed!!!
