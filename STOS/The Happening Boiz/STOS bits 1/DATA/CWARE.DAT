What Is Commission-Ware
=======================

Commission Ware is a new and exciting development for Public Domain (PD). 
Commission Ware aims to keep the flow of new, good and quality software that
has become commonplace in PD.  However, unlike PD, Commission Ware aims to
bring some small financial reward to the programmer.  For each disk sold the
programmer will receive a portion of the profits.  Hence the name Commission
Ware.

The Commission
==============

Each disk in the Commission Ware library will cost œ3 for a normal, average
quality, program or game.  For each disk sold the author of the software will
receive 50p.  That means the user of the software can purchase 'PD type'
software at a PD price but also contribute towards the authors hard earned
efforts it took to write the software.  It will also mean that the programmer
is encouraged (and has increased funds) to write more and better software.

Being a commission based service the program/author will earn money earned on
the merits of his/hers own programs.  If the program is of above-average
quality, the cost charged for the software will increase from the normal œ3
giving the author a bigger commission on each disk.  If the author wishes,
s/he can set his/her own price to be charged for their software as long as a
minimum of œ3 is being charged.

Copyright
=========

Disks in the Commission Ware library are exclusive to TRuST PD.  Although the
programs copyright remains exclusive to the programmer or author of the
software.  Disks can be withdrawn from the library at any time, something
almost impossible to do if the program was in Public Domain.

Please NOTE, this is not the normal TRuST PD address.  If you are buying a
Commission Ware disk write to the NORMAL HALIFAX address as if you were
ordering normal PD disks.

What Type Of Software
=====================

Any - Simplest answer we can give.  Game / Application / Utility - It does
not matter - even if its a really specialist program.

If you have some small utilities which do not make up a complete disk we hope
you can still sell it through Commission Ware.  Perhaps 4 or 5 small programs
will go on to one disk and the authors spilt the profits.  This very much
depends on the software - however we will try our best to give you the best
deal.
