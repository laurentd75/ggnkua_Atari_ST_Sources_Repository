~~~~~~~~~ BY EDDIE OF THE HAPPENING BOIZ 1990 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The source code for this effect can be found in the programm 
folder it is called would you believe WOBBLE.BAS.
 To run the screen you will need to load a PACKED picture file 
into memory bank 4.

This simple program will create a wobbly screen, it does this by 
generating a sine table, and then tagging sections of the screen 
to different parts of the sine wave, the result is a rectangle of 
the screen will move up and down in a sine wave !!!!
 This effect is no different from a sine wave made up of sprites, 
except that you are using vertical strips of the screen instead 
of sprites.
 The effect isn't as good as it could be for a start STOS has to 
roundn X coords to the nearset 16 bit boundary which means you 
can only wobble blocks which are 16 pixels wide.
 Using the 16 bit boundaries can generate stunning results, by 
outputting TEXT to the screen using the supplied FONTS.MBK (Xenon 
2 and Spherical in programm folder!) you can create the type of 
wobbly intro's that come on many of the demos such as the 
infamous UNION DEMO, in fact this wobble code was first used in 
the first ever version of STOS BITS to generate intro screens to 
the different demos that we included on the disc (which will 
NEVER be released because it is so crap!!)
 Well Monty Python is on the box so I must go........bye.
