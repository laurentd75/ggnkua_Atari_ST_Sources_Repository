DIZZY LIZZY by THE HAPPENING BOIZ
 (Published By Budgie, œ2.95)

 The Happening Boiz attained critical acclaim for the graphics of 
Hostile Reception, their second game. This was a shoot-em-up, but 
their third game, Dizzy Lizzy, is somewhat different.

 Based (to some extent) on the Boulder Dash theme, D.L. is an 
arcade game with (yes, OK Eddie) some strategy. You must collect 
the diamonds hidden in a cavern while avoiding the problems of 
falling boulders, bombs, dynamite, fungus (Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Fungus, perhaps?), ice and the villainous Wayne. (Hello Wayne!)
You must complete 40 levels of danger- infested screens before 
completing the game.

 Dizzy Lizzy boots up with a nice piece of music, but is slow in 
loading and decompacting. The attractive title screen gives 
options (selected by joystick) of high-scores (with some 
interesting messages), instructions (showing the hazards you are 
faced with) or starting the game. Pressing fire to select start, 
you are greeted by a nice picture and a password entry. Entering 
ORIENT for the first level, there is a short load, then the 
screen's info appears. Pressing a key throws you into the guts of 
the game.

 The best things about this game are the graphics. Dizzy is very 
cute, the diamonds have sparkle and bombs, rocks etc. are easily 
recognisable. Probably the first way you'll die is by hanging 
around a bomb, thinking it hasn't gone off. Fooled you! THe bomb 
is a time-delayed bomb and only goes off after about five moves. 
You die and go to the same screen as before, but with a good 
sample and a humourous message (I told you not to play with 
things, Mr Spoons is a good one). Pressing fire returns you to 
the game.

 (Oooops, almost forgot. When you die the lives sheet is torn 
off. Most people probably won't notice it, but Eddie will kill me 
if I don't mention it. He thinks its amazing, for some reason!)

 Completing level one is pretty easy, and very soon you will get 
the password to level two (well, as you're my friends, I'll tell 
you it's AMAZON) and another screen. Further on in the game, you 
will encounter Wayne in all his glory, chasing mercilessly, ice 
(with the s**t-scared Dizzy covering his eyes), rebounders (to 
stop you going where THEY don't want you to) and a series of 
devious screen designs to stop you completing the game. The sheer 
frustration of being unable to complete a screen, however, is 
very addictive. So much so, in fact, I almost became glued to my 
joystick for a while!

 When you finally foul up enough to die, you get presented with a 
normal message screen, then a status screen. (A suggestion: why 
not put the screen's password on here so you can remember it?) 
After pressing fire, the high-score entry comes up. This is the 
worst-presented part of the game, being extremely spartan in 
comparison with other parts of the game. The actual high-score 
screen is very good. The only other criticism is the time taken 
to load everything up.

 Now, critical time. The graphics are very good, and in fact I 
would rate them as some of the best cartoon-style graphics I've 
ever seen, but other aspects of the game are not so strong. It is 
not amazingly original, taking ideas from everything from Repton 
to Bombuzal, and the music is repetitive and can't be switched 
off easily (in fact, it's probably easier to turn down the volume 
on the TV). I also managed to crash the game a couple of times 
(anyone want a playtester? I'm available!). Some of the game's 
responses were also a bit slow.

 But the worst aspect was it's difficulty. In a weekend I managed 
to complete the game, and even if I hadn't played it to saturat- 
ion I would no doubt have finished it in a couple of weeks. Far 
to many of the screens could be completed without losing a life 
(and they weren't all mine either Eddie!) and none really stopped 
me for long.

 So, in conclusion.

          Sound          Some good music, some annoying.
                         Good spot effects.                 84%
          Graphics       Graphics and overall presentation
                         are excellent. You'll love Dizzy.  92%
          Playability    Very good speed (for STOS) but 
                         overall too easy. Also some long
                         disk accesses.                      71%
          Addictiveness  Extremely addictive. In fact
                         (cliche ahoy) I couldn't put my 
                         joystick down!                     97%
          OVERALL        Polished dodge-em game that's
                         addictive but easy. Brill for the
                         kids, amazing at the price.
                                                            93%

Review by The Cool Carrot, 22/10/90. And honestly, I'm not 
biased. Do NOT buy Hostile Reception: the graphics are good but 
the gameplays Rap with a capital....
