Title:  The Giant Demo
Coded By: The Cool Carrot (Paul Mison)
Language: STOS (Oh no!!!!! not STOS, yes STOS.)

This is a small demo, with various demo screens that can be run by 
clicking on their names using a pull down menu system, there are 
graphics demos, sound demos, and thats about it really,the best 
screens are the cylinder scroll, which is a doubled barrel scroller, 
and is very effective(So cool infact that I am going to rip the code 
and use it for my TAP DEMO screen.).Debounce is the best of the lot, 
and the source code is on THIS disc right as I type to you, it is very 
simple it just drops balls which gradually bounce down, down, down and 
down until they run out of enegy, THEN another ball drops, It really 
good....Honest.
 For a demo written in STOS it is reasonable, but as with the decade 
demo, its nothing to write home about.

Marks out of 10:

Graphics:    4
Sound:       7
Coding:      5
Originality: 7
Over all:    7
 
I don't know if this demo is in the PD catalogues, but is you want the 
source code, or the demo just drop me a line and I will see what I can 
do.
