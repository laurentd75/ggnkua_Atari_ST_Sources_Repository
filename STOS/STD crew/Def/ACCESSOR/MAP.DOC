
                 The STOS Map and Room designer

 This accessory program has been supplied so that you may 
construct rooms of background data which can be used in platform 
and ladder type games. It enables you to build up a variety of 
locations which can be displayed and used from within your own 
program.

 Games such as Gauntlet, Time Bandit and Bratacas have various 
background displays. Each display is made up from a set of 
sprites. This is where a map designer can speed up the 
development of a map-type game. Each location can be designed 
with the mouse, then the relevant data and controlling program 
can be saved out to disc and then merged into your program.

 You can even use the sprite editor to grab background sprites 
from many commercial games, modify them to suit your needs, then 
use them in the map definer to create your own displays.

                           Terminology

 The first thing to understand about the map editor is the 
terminology used. When the word "ROOM" is used it refers to a 
single screen of sprite images. These images or building blocks 
are used to construct a room. You must of course design some 
sprites before using the map editor using one of the sprite 
accessories. We have supplied a demo file of sprites called 
MAP.MBK - the sprites in this file are 16x16 in size and depict 
walls, floors, treasure and potions. Using these sprites you can 
design screens similar to those found in Gauntlet.

 Another word to become familiar with is "MAP". This refers to 
a list of rooms. By moving an animated character in a game you 
could allow him to travel from room to room. This grid of rooms 
is similar to a grid on a local area map - hence the name map.

                     Using the map designer

 When you first enter the map designer, the first thing you 
encounter is a file selector. From this you must load up a sprite 
file to use for designing rooms. This file will be analysed by 
the designer to work out how many sprites can be plotted on the 
screen. The very first sprite is used to calculate how many 
sprites fit across and down the screen, dictated by its X and Y 
sizes. It's a good idea then to position map sprites at the start 
of the sprite bank.

 Once the sprites have been loaded you are presented with the 
design screen. From this screen all the editing, loading/saving 
and manipulating of rooms takes place.

                         Editing a room

 At the base of the design screen is the control window. This is 
used for many purposes and provides an easy-to-use environment. 
When your pointer is over the window you can select the various 
options from within it, but when you move it into the blank area 
it can be used for plotting sprites onto the screen. Because the 
room is a full screen in size, the window can be moved up and 
down. If you wish to view and edit the whole screen you can do so 
by pressing the Spacebar.

 The sprite used for plotting is the middle sprite out of the 
three displayed in the window. You can select other sprites using 
the arrow icons.

 <  (Select previous sprite)
 << (Select first sprite in the sprite bank)
 >  (Select next sprite)
 >> (Select last sprite)

 To plot a sprite onto the screen you must move the mouse pointer 
around the room display area and press the left mouse button. You 
can delete a sprite by pressing on the right button.

 The window will get in the way at times, so to move it about 
we have supplied various ways to do so.

 TOP  (Position the window at the top of the screen)
 BASE (Position the window at the base of the screen)
 MOVE (Move the window up or down using the mouse button)

 As we said above you can also remove the window by pressing the 
Spacebar, but you will also need to return to the window to 
select other sprites and functions and this can be achieved by 
pressing the Spacebar again.

                         Creating a map

 When you have designed your first room you can go on to create 
more rooms. The menu titled ROOM has 7 selections which you can 
press on. The one we are interested in at the moment is 'ADD'. 
Press on the ADD area and the TOTAL number of rooms will increase 
by 1 and you will now be editing ROOM 2. Don't worry about room 1 
- it's still in memory and can be called up by pressing on the < 
button in the ROOM menu.

 Here is a description of the selections in the ROOM menu.

 <      (Go back to the previous room)
 >      (Go forward to the next room)
 <<     (Go to room 1)
 >>     (Go to the end room)
 ADD    (Add a new room to the end of the list and edit it)
 INSERT (Insert a new room infront of the current room)
 DELETE (Delete the current room)

                  Storing and programming maps

 When you have completed a map you can save it out as a .MAP 
file. This can then be loaded back in at a later date using the 
LOAD function in the FILE menu. These files are only for loading 
and saving from within the map designer. To use the designs in 
your games you must use the S.ASC option which will save out an 
Ascii file. To merge in the file, load in your game and type the 
following line:

          LOAD "filename.ASC"

 The word filename must be replaced by the name you saved the 
file under. The program lines will now merge into the current 
program in memory at line 50000. You will need to ensure that 
your program does not contain conflicting line numbers, otherwise 
they will be overwritten.

 Now you can call the routine with these small couple of lines:


   10 mode 0:ROOM=1
   20 gosub 50000

 The variable ROOM signifies which room will be displayed to the 
screen.

 Another little trick is to copy the colour palette out of the 
sprite bank. This can be achieved with the following Basic 
commands which is also included in the map definer program:

     99 rem *** Find palette address in memory ***
     100 X=hunt(start(1) to start(1)+length(1),"PALT")
     109 rem *** Add 4 to pass by the string PALT ***
     110 X=X+4
     119 rem *** Copy the palette into the current palette ***
     120 for a=0 to 15
     130 colour a,deek(X) : X=X+2
     140 next a

 Here is a description of the file menu.

LOAD  (Load a map for editing)
SAVE  (Save a map to disc)
S.ASC (Save an Ascii Basic program)
QUIT  (Exit from the map designer)
GRID  (Change the grid size of the current room)

 The GRID command is used to re-calculate the X and Y axis. This 
is dictated by the current sprite. So if you find that a larger 
set of sprites are to be used in certain rooms you can re-size 
the coordinates, and not be restricted by the default size set by 
the first sprite in the bank. To see how this works, load MAP.MBK 
into the sprite editor, make one of the sprites twice the size 
using the Set X/Y menu, then save out the file as MAP2.MBK. Load 
the map definer, select the large sprite and click on GRID. Now 
the large sprite will fit in amoung the other sprites on the 
screen.

                        Points to remember

 When you design your sprites remember these following points:

 * Always keep the hot spot in the top left hand corner.

 * Try to keep all sprites the same size.

 * Sprites less than 16 across and 8 down will not be allowed by
   the sprite editor.
