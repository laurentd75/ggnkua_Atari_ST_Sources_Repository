                      16 KHZ REPLAY FOR STOS
                           ===========


     At last, a decent mod replay program for Stos.
Although this program doesn't run on interrupt it still plays a 
far better quality sound than the Stos tracker extension.  That 
was the 'good' thing about the Stos tracker.

     The original code for the routine was by Griff of Electronic 
Images - before anyone points out that I didn't code it - all I 
did was to take out and add various lines of code so that it would 
run through Stos.

     The routine is dead easy to use.  What we do first is pass 
the address of the mod into AREG(0), then simply CALL the program.  
One word of warning though:-  the program must be in a higher bank 
than the mod otherwise the mod will sound corrupt.  So put the 
program in bank 15.

10 areg(0)=start(10) : rem the mod bank
20 call start(15)+28 : rem call the replay routine

     It's as simple as that.


     Please feel free to copy and distribute this program and 
example file but ensure that this doc file goes with it.



     And one more thing - if you do use this program then don't 
forget to give credit where credit is due.  That means Griff for 
the original code and me for the Stos version.  No doubt someone 
out there has a good routine that plays on interrupt -  well if so 
then why keep it to yourself - let us all share it!
     But until then this one will have to do - not unless you know 
different!
