In order for you to use this tutorial you will need a copy of the 
STOS adventure Creator (SAC),  please note that this tutorial  is 
for use in STOSSER only........

 In this tutorial I am going to show you how to write a full
 adventure game called Witches Castle using SAC.

 The story goes like this... The wicked witch has kidnapped the 
 princess and is holding her captive in the castle. A warrior has 
 been charged with the task of defeating the witch and rescuing 
 the princess then leaving the castle.

 So we have the plot and the main character, so we shall define a 
 game world which is the castle. Lets make a note of the locations 
 we would find in a castle, the list would look like this...

 Castle entrance
 Main hall
 Dungeon
 Throne room
 Musty room

 Of course, a castle would have more locations than this but I'm 
 just keeping it short and simple. Now lets add two more.

 Lake
 Enchanted Forest

 In this game the player would start at the castle entrance and 
 these two locations can be on either side of him while the castle 
 is in front of him.

 Now we need some objects which are as followed..

 A steel key..... used to unlock the dungeon door
 An axe....... To kill the rat
 Guards uniform... Has to be worn to get pass the guards
 A Goblet... Contains holy water which kills the witch
  
 Now we've worked this out, we can enter the information into Sac.

 Load the creator, go to the location menu and insert the 
 following seven locations.

  Location 1

  You stand before the mighty castle which is north. On the top of 
  it is a ugly stone gargoyle whose stare sends a shiver up your 
  spine. You can also go west and east.

  Location 2

  You are beside a beautiful lake which glimmers under the morning 
  sun. It is surrounded by clusters of trees and bushes which glow 
  brightly. You can only go east.

  Location 3

  You find yourself in the Enchanted Forest which is dark and 
  creepy. The trees and bushes have no beauty and make further 
  movement impossible except west.

  Location 4

  The main hall of the castle. It has a certain mist of evil about 
  it and full of old junk. To the east stands an arched doorway 
  and west a dungeon. You can also go north and south.

  Location 5

  You find yourself outside the castle dungeon and all you see is 
  a large steel door. The hall is east.

  Location 6

  Emerging into the Throne Room you see nothing but murkey cobwebs 
  and a small steel throne. You can see a large cauldron and an 
  arched doorway leading west.

  Location 7

  You are in a bare musty room. A doorway is south.

 Now go to the connection definer and insert these connections.

  Location 1

  West to location 2, East to location 3

  Location 2
 
  East to location 1

  Location 3

  West to location 1

  Location 4

  South to location 1, West to location 5, East to location 6
  North to location 7

  Location 5

  East to location 4

  Location 6

  West to location 4

  Location 7

  South to location 4

 Now enter the objects in the object definer along with their 
 locations and object words.
 
  Object 1...a steel key., location (not created), key
  Object 2...an axe., location 3, axe
  Object 3...a guards uniform., location 2, uniform
  Object 4...a goblet., location (not created),goblet

 Go straight to the Message definer (m) and enter these messages.

  Message 1

  The water melts the witch into nothing and drops the key.

  Message 2

  As you are wearing the uniform, the guards lower the drawbridge 
  to let you in.

  Message 3

  You kill the rat and a goblet of holy water appears.

  Message 4

  The witch is here, she is holding a steel key.

  Message 5

  You unlock the door and the princess runs out and gives you a 
  big hug then says C'mon lets leave this castle.

  Message 6

  There is a vicious rat here.

  Message 7

  The princess is here.

  Message 8

  Well done, you have rescued the princess and completed your task.

  Message 9

  The guards refuse to let you in the castle.

 If you wish, you can add some examine messages to the game, this 
 involves four messages in the Examine Object option and as many 
 as you want in the Examine Location option.

 Now we have all the data we need for now, if you wish to add more 
 later you can always load it back in.

 Now save your data file, load Stos, and load the Editor program.

 As you may have guessed we have a rat and a witch in the game as 
 well as a princess so lets define them as varibles.

  WITCH=1 : PRINCESS=0 : RAT=1

  So at this moment the witch and rat are alive and the princess 
  is not yet rescued. Add this lines as H_P events

  if LOC=1 and OB_LOC(3)<>W0RN then print MESSAGE$(9)
  if LOC=1 and OB_LOC(3)=W0RN then print MESSAGE$(2) : MAP(1,1)=4
  if LOC=6 and WITCH=1 then print MESSAGE$(4)
  if LOC=7 and RAT=1 then print MESSAGE$(6)
  if MEET=1 then PRINCESS=LOC : print MESSAGE$(7)
  if LOC=1 and PRINCESS=LOC then print MESSAGE$(8) : goto 2610

 The first event tells Stos that if the player is not wearing the 
 uniform the guards won't let him in and the second event tells 
 Stos that the guards will let him in because he's wearing the 
 uniform. The varible W0RN holds the location of worn objects which 
 is 1000. Now add these L_P events.

  If WRD$(1)="throw" and WRD$(2)="goblet" and OB_LOC(4)=CARRIED 
  then OB_LOC(4)=NC : OB_LOC(1)=LOC : print MESSAGE$(1) : NO=1 : 
  WRD$(1)="" : WRD$(2)="" : WITCH=0 : DONE=1

 So when the goblet is throw, it vanishes to the not created 
 location and the key is created at put at the players location.

  If WRD$(1)="kill" and WRD$(2)="rat" and OB_LOC(2)=CARRIED then 
  RAT=0 : OB_LOC(4)=LOC : print MESSAGE$(3) : NO=1 : WRD$(1)="" : 
  WRD$(2)="" : DONE=1

 This line kills the rat and creates the goblet.

  If WRD$(1)="unlock" and WRD$(2)="door" and OB_LOC(1)=CARRIED 
  then print MESSAGE$(5) : MEET=1 : NO=1 : WRD$(1)="" : WRD$(2)="" 
  : DONE=1

 This line rescues the princess.
    
  Well..... thats it, the game is finished, all you have to do is 
  change the loading name from 'game.adv' to the one you choose 
  when you saved the data from the creator. Give it a test run and 
  correct any mistakes you find, when your sure it works okay then 
  why not add a few extras like samples, music and graphics. You 
  can then save it as a run only program, many even compile it and 
  give it to all your friends.

 As you can see, you have just written a full adventure game in 
 just one day, with more practise you could write large more 
 complex games with Sac and give them away if you wish.

 Before I go, I will give you one last example of how the player 
 can fight monsters which can take more than one hit.

 Lets say the player can take 10 hits and the monster can take 5, 
 all you have to do is set and name two varibles.

 MONSTER=5 : PLAYER=10

 Then using the method described in chapter 5, use a L_P event to 
 take a point from each varible every time then use an H_P in the 
 L_P section to check if any of the varibles equal 0 and if so, 
 use a message to tell the player that either he or the monster is 
 dead and either end the game or give him some points.

 Well thats the end of this tutorial, I hope you've enjoyed it 
 as much as I've enjoyed writing it.

  Have fun...........Deano
