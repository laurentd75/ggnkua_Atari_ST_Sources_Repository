				CRYSTAL1

You'll probably recognize this game from The Crystal Maze. I've 
shamelessly nicked it. Well - this is not for money and I don't 
see any sign of an official Crystal Maze game. (And why not?)

The object of the game is simple. Place all the numbers on the 
"grid" so that no two consecutive numbers occupy adjacent slots. 
Click on the number you want to move with the left mouse button. 
It will disappear. Now click on the slot where you want to place 
it. You guessed - it will appear again! In this way you can move a 
number from the side onto the grid, or from one slot to another. 
You can remove a number from the grid using the right mouse 
button. If you think you've got it, click on Howzat and the 
program will check it out. I won't insult you by explaining what 
Quit does.

The program is PD. If you've got any comments I'd like to hear 
from you. Vegetable rights and peace.
