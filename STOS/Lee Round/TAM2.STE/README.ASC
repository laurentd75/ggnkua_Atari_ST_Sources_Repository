        T.A.M. Telephone Answering Machine STe Version 2
               Written for Stosser 27 May 1995
                        By Lee J Round

This program is used to record a Movie Sample onto your own
answering machine, It saves you having to record a boring message
such as 'I am not in leave a message etc.

I have used this same program to put a sample onto my own machine
and it sounds great, even though my message was taken from a 
favourite show of mine. The actor (Nick Mancuso) actually
said my number (Stroke of luck) but the way he pronounced it,
was very spooky indeed.

Now when anyone phones me they get this very cool message and
believe me, i have had a few people hesitating before leaving
their own message.

This is the second Version of TAM and it's only available from
Stosser, even though it is PD Software.
If you happen to use any of the samples that was included with
version one then you will get a few laughs, It really makes the 
person who is phoning you burst out in tears of laughter.

If you want to use any of these samples then feel free because
it really makes a difference, Than just a normal boring message.

               -------------------------------

If there is enough disk space on this issue of Stosser you will
find a sample or two for use with TAM.

I have created a few samples to use on your own answering machine
such as, Fletch' Back to the future' and Diehard.
The other samples Terminator & Bugs are to be used as background 
music as this will make your outgoing message sound really cool.
Believe me it does sound impressive than just your own voice 
waffling on, I should know.

What else' well there is No ST version Of TAM and i have to say
that TAM will not reach Version 3 because i moving onto other
things such as my 'Interdisk Project' all will be revealed in
a future issue of Stosser.

I do not claim to be the best programer in the world because i am 
not, I am only writing these programs because of stosser.
I want to keep it going for a long time and it gives me a chance
to send my  ( Big Word Coming Up )  contributions into Stosser.

Good God, The time is 2:22 AM on monday night, where was i....
OH yes, Stosser, well i like to use Digitized Graphics and sampled
sound in my programs and that is what Interdisk is all about.

Actually it was stosser that gave me the idea for my Interdisk
project and to reveal even more, lets just say Bob Goodfellow.
Now i bet i have a few people wondering what this Interdisk is
well im not telling anyone Okay or is it Kayo.


               --------------------------------

Please note that TAM is just a novelty program with a serious side
to it and please treat it as such, That said i do hope you find
it useful.

If you have any comments about TAM then get in touch with me
but please send an S.A.E, your letter can be on disk or paper and
i will give you a reply.

The source for TAM is available if you want it but please send
a blank disk and SAE, more sample disks are available.
If it helps anyone then i do not mind anyone having it after all
its there for all stosser's.
Time is now getting on and i must get some sleep otherwise my
eyes will become Bag city (Bags under the eyes... It's a joke)

Never mind....

Well thats it for now, I do hope you find TAM useful and remember
to keep on Stossing......
I would like to thank Tony Greenwood For use of his ZOOM Routine
which i have included into T.A.M, Many thanks Tony.
