                                CRACK CONVERT


This program is a simple Crack art picture convertor that allows you to easily
convert Crack art CA1 pictures into Degas PI1 pictures with no effort.

Just run it, enter the name of your Crack art picture to convert, and then enterthe name of the Degas file it is to be saved as!

I have enclosed the source code in STOS for you to see how it was done. N.B. it
requires the Control extension version 3.0+ to run.
