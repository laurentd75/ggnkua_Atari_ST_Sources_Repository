           Installation
**********************************

This package contains the following
files:

    MIDI.BAS - Basic MIDI player
               routines.

    MIDI.PRG - Assembly MIDI player
               routines.

    MIDIPLAY.BAS - Example program
                   using assembly
                   routines.

    MUSIC2.ACB - STOS music accesory
                 modified to read and
                 play MIDI notes.

    Replace your current music
accesory with MUSIC2.ACB. Use MIDI.PRG
for optimum performance to play STOS
music through the MIDI port. Use
MIDI.BAS for the same thing if
MIDI.PRG does not work for some
reason. Run MIDIPLAY.BAS for an
example of using MIDI.PRG.

*************************************
        MIDI.PRG INSTRUCTIONS
*************************************

1. Load your basic program.

2. Reserve a memory bank as data 5000
   bytes large.

3. Load the binary file MIDI.PRG into
   the memory bank. Use BLOAD.

4. Load in the music file (memory bank
   3).

5. At the start of the program
   initialize:

      AREG(4)=START(3)
      AREG(5)=START(x)+1924
         where x is the bank MIDI.PRG
         resides in.

6. Before the music is played, Set:

      DREG(7)=MUSNUM
         where MUSNUM is the music
             number.
      DREG(6)=P1
         where P1 is the synth tone #
             for channel 1.
         Use -1 if the tone is
             specified in the music.
      DREG(5)=P2
         where P2 is the synth tone #
             for channel 2.
         Use -1 if the tone is
             specified in the music.
      DREG(4)=P3
         where P3 is the synth tone #
             for channel 3.
         Use -1 if the tone is
              specified in the music.

      Note that the tone numbers start
      at zero, MUSNUM starts at one.

7. To start the music use:

      CALL START(x)
         where x is the bank
         containing MIDI.PRG

8. You must use the following command
   in a loop to continually play
   music:

      CALL START(x)+530
         where x is the bank
         containing MIDI.PRG

9. To end the music use:

      DREG(7)=0 : CALL START(x)
         where x is the bank
         containing MIDI.PRG

    Check out the file MIDIPLAY.BAS to
see an example using this method.

**************************************
         MIDI.BAS INSTRUCTIONS
**************************************

1. Merge the file MIDI.BAS into your
   program.

2. Set MUSNUM to the music number,
       PA1 to the synth tone number
                of channel 1, or
           to -1 if the tone is                        specified in the music
       PA2 to the synth tone number
                of channel 2, or
           to -1 if the tone is
                specified in the music
       PA3 to the synth tone number
                of channel 3, or
           to -1 if the tone is
                specified in the music

3. To start the music:
         GOSUB 60000

4. To continually play the music, you
   must have this in the main loop:
         GOSUB 61000

5. To end the music:
         GOSUB 62000

**************************************
       MUSIC2.ACB INSTRUCTIONS
**************************************

    This is a modified version of the
 music accessory that came with STOS.
 Now it is much easier to enter music
 with this accesory. You can enter
 notes using your synth in one of
 three input modes. Also, music can be
 played back through the synth and
 tones can be specified.

1. Configuring the MIDI input:

    a) Under the TOOLS menu, select
       "Setup MIDI".

    b) Left Click on the Input Mode
       Bar to choose between the three
       modes.

    c) Right click on the Tempo Bar to
       increase the tempo (number of
       quarter notes input in a
       minute).

    d) Left click on the Tempo Bar to
       decrease the tempo.

    e) Left or Right click on the
       Resolution Bar to change the
       resolution (smallest note that
       can be input).

    f) Left Click OK to enter those
       values, or CANCEL to exit.

2. Playing in MANUAL mode:

    Try different keys on the synth
 until you find the note you want.
 Hold down the key for the desired
 duration. When you have a note of the
 desired frequency and duration, press
 return to enter the note.

    Note that the C5 key (midi code
 84, highest on the keyboard for the
 CASIO MT240) will not return a note
 in this mode, but is used for
 entering rests.

    Hit any Tone key on the synth,
 then return to change the tone.

    Hit Rhythm key 2 to transpose down
 an octave, key 3 to transpose up an
 octave then return to enter it (midi
 codes 1, and 2).

3. Playing in AUTO mode:

    This works the same as MANUAL mode
 except that notes are entered
 automatically, you don't have to hit
 return.

4. Playing in TIMED mode:

    This mode is used for real-time
 playing. Hit Rhythm Key 1 (midi code
 0), or any key on the synth keyboard
 to start playing. While no keys are
 being pressed, rests are entered in
 this mode. It works almost like a
 recorder.

    Hit Rhythm Key 1 (midi code 0) to
 stop playing.

    Key C5 enters its note as normal.

    All other keys work the same as
 the other modes.

5. Playing Back the Music

    a) Choose PLAY or PUT AND PLAY as
       normal from the menu.

    b) If the tones are not specified
       in the music, then first hit a
       number key corrosponding to the
       channel (1,2, or 3). Then hit
       two more digits corrosponding
       to the two-digit tone number.
       Do this for each channel.

    c) Hit M to start or stop the MIDI
       music.

    d) All other keys work as normal.

        HARDWARE CONSIDERATIONS
**************************************

    This package was developed using a
 CASIO MT-240. This is a fairly
 primitive synthesizer (although it
 has high quality tone banks). I
 cannot guarantee that all features
 will work on all synths, however the
 features implemented are basic enough
 that there should not be any major
 problems. Of course, none of the
 features of more expensive synths are
 implemented. Probably the most
 problems you may have would be with
 the keys used as input in the
 MUSIC.ACB accesory. That is why I
 have given the MIDI codes in the
 documentation. If you do not have a
 synth, I recommend the CASIO-MT240
 for beginners, or computer hobbiests
 like me. The sound quality is high
 for many of the tones (some tones do
 fade in the low range). It has a
 great Piano tone. Also, it is
 inexpensive (I saw one at a Hills for
 $99).
