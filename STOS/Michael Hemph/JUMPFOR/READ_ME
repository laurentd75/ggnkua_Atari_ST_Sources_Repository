


       JUMP FOR YOUR LIFE 
 



         THE STORY IS

YOU MUST SAVE THE EARTH AGAINST THE
EVIL ONE. TO DO THAT YOU MUST GO
THROUGH THE SIX LEVELS. AND WHEN
YOU HAVE 5 BILLIONS LIFE SO YOU CAN 
SAVE ALL INHABITANTS ON THE EARTH.
 
HOWEVER THAT FUNCTION IS NOT BUILT 
IN BECAUSE THE TIME WAS NEARLY UP 
WHEN WE SHOULD TRY TO WRITE THE
STORY OF THE GAME. 


YOU MOVE THE MAN WITH JOYSTICK IN PORT 1.                                        1.
         
RIGHT   =     LITTLE JUMP TO RIGHT
LEFT    =     LITTLE JUMP TO LEFT 

RIGHT + FIRE BUTTON =  BIG JUMP TO RIGHT
LEFT + FIRE BUTTON  =  BIG JUMP TO LEFT

JUST FIRE BUTTON  =  A JUMP STRAIGHT UP
 
                 
           REMEMBER!
YOU MUST TAKE SOME SMALL JUMPS
BEFORE YOU TAKE A BIG JUMP
