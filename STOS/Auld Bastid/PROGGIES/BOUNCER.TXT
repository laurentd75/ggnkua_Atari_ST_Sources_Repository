Bouncy, Bouncy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ever needed somthing to bounce, you know follow the curve of a 
rubber ball.

One way of making 'realistic' bounces is to use a SINE or COSINE waveform.
This however means that you are using floating point maths, and so
consequently it takes a lot of time. (relatively speaking)

This little routine take very little time and has a realistic bounce.
Alos, because it's doen in 'real time' you can alter its parameters in
'real time' so creating all manner of wierd and wonderful bouncing arcs.

The routine itself is well REMmed so I won't explain it here.

Let's get those balls bouncing....(har har)
