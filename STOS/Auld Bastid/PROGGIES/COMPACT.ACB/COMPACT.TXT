                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The comapction routine used in STOS is tremendous. It has a packing ratio
similar to the famous Tiny format.

Unfortunately the compact utility only allows you to load standard
Neochrome or uncompressed Degas pictures. Most of my art packages accept
the compressed Degas so why shouldn't the compactor.

Additionally, the enhancement will de-compact the tiny format piccies.
Wow! cool.

Everything in the accessory functions the way it did before, except that
you can load .PC1, .PC2, .PC3 AND .TNY format pictures. erm. that's it.

One more point; the Tiny depacker will only recognise the extension
.TNY but will handle the correct resolution. 

Otherwise everything works in all three resolutions and does not require 
any additional extensions to work. So ya boo hiss to extensions!!!
