
Simple Vertical Scroller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nothing really much to say about this program. It's a simple vertical
scrolly 'fing. If you use MISTY then you can get a scroller running
alongside a STOS Tracker tune running at 10Khz. It may be a bit on the
naff side, but it's better than nowt.

Actually you can probably get the scroller working even without MISTY
I've not tried but I think it would.
