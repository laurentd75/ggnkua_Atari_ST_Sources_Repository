STOS tracker routine fixed to run from STOS by Neil W. Stewart
______________________________________________________________



First of all choose the AMIGA module that you want to replay.

Copy the chosen module onto the root directory of the disk that the TRACK 
folder is on.

Change the name of the file at the end of the source file that is incbined.

Assemble the file to a filename of your choice ( eg. STOSTRAC.PRG )

How to replay the module
________________________

load the file into a memory bank, I recomend 15

load"STOSTRAC.PRG",15

to run the module..

call start(15)+28

And hey presto amazing sound from STOS on interrupt, and on the subject, if
you have heard the replay quality of STOS TRACKER, you will be doubly 
amazed.

to stop the music 

call start(15)+28

and hey presto, complete silence.



SLIGHT PROBLEM
______________

Unfortunately the routine turns of certain interupts, namely timer B
and that is what STOS uses for its inkey$ command.This means that the
keyboard will not respond AT ALL.To get round this we have to read the
keyboard chip directly...

c=peek($FFFFFC02)  ( 5 'F's )

c is the scancode of the key that you want to check for eg.


10 call start(15)+28          ; initialise music
20 repeat                     ; set up loop
30 c=peek($FFFFC02)           ; read keyboard chip
40 until c=57                 ; check for space and end 
50 call start(15)+28          ; stop music
60 end                        ; stop program


NEVER ever call the music from the editor, it will lock up the
whole system.Always stop the music before you end the program

If you have any complaints then just think of the quailty difference
between This replay ( which is 8 kiloherts) and 14 kiloherts STOS TRACKER
