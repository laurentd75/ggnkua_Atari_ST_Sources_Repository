                          REQUIREMENTS

works.  If anybody has come up with a routine to make STOS work on  STs 
with TOS greater than 1.62, then send it to me, PLEASE!!!

TO BE FUNNY, JUST QUIT THIS DOC AND LOAD THE GAME.

The year :  2092,  The location :  New New York,  Mars. A new amusement 
park has just opened. One of the main attractions are the hoverscooters 
which float above a square arena of variable size. Unfortunately, after 
the  novelty wears off,  floating about aimlessly becomes dead  boring. 
This  all changed when an enterprising young lad from  Oberon  realised 
that  when  you remove that weird knob on the bottom of  your  scooter, 
it's fuel (liquid uranium-235) leaks out and makes a lovely mess on the 
ground.  When  he  moved his scooter,  he saw that the uranium  made  a 
trail.  Being  an  artistic  person,  he started to  draw  pictures  of 
anything that he could think of at the time. The other people currently 
hovvering around the arena who were half asleep with boredom saw  these 
magnificent works of art and to wake themselves up,  they said,  "Oh my 
god,  just look at those magnificent works of art!!!" Their moments  of 
joy soon ended because one hoverscooters touched the uranium trails and 
spontaneously exploded. The other users of the hovercraft decided to do 
the  same because even death is more exciting than floating around  too 
long.  The  owner of the arena,  who was already being  bombarded  with 
insults  about the boredom of the place,  had to face up to the  deaths 
as  well.  However,  these  two facts combined made  an  attraction  in 
itself.  The people who had realises that they wasted an important part 
of  their lives floating around (about twenty minutes) could  have  the 
chance  to  commit  suicide this way,  but to make  it  more  exciting, 
everybody had to survive as long as they could,  and the winner was the 
last  person alive.  All scooters would leak their fuel in a  different 
colour  and this seemed so exciting that once they  had  started,  they 
wanted to kill off their opponents rather than themselves so that  they 
could live to remember this.  This eventually lead to be a galaxy  wide 
sport with stadiums packed with dillions of fans...

I APPOLOGISE FOR THE CRAP STOREYLINE, BUT IT WAS THE BEST I COULD THINK 
UP AT THE TIME.

So? what the **** has this got to do with the bloody game? 

    What  you are about to play is the computer-game  version  of  this 
sport.  Only here,  the uranium trails are called lines,  and when  you 
die,  you crash into either the edge of the arena or a line,  hence the 
name "Line crash" (the original game had no name, but as all it's fans, 
players,  etc.  often say,  "Who cares!" (somebody once thought of  the 
name "Uranium-trail die" but that seemed a bit silly)). In case you 
slept  through the main storeyline (I did,  and that was  just  writing 
it!)  the  object of the game is using your own  line,  trap  all  your 
opponent's  lines until they are forced to crash,  and making sure  you 
don't crash yourself.
   This game can be played by up to eight players (Two using the normal 
joysticks,  two using the paralell printer interface,  and on the  STE, 
four  joysticks plugged into the two ports on the side (for details  of 
how  to connect the extra joysticks,  see JOYSTICK.DOC).  On the  title 
screen,  you can see which joysticks are in use. Which are being played 
by droids, and which are out of play. By default, Joystick one (the one 
that  plugs into the port next to the mouse) is controlled by a  human, 
and  there are three droids playing.  Next to the name of each type  of 
joystick  (in dark-red) is a function key (in  dark-blue).  Press  this 
function key,  and the text next to it will cycle from OFF (that player 
is  not  playing),  DROID  (that  player is  being  controlled  by  the 
computer),  HUMAN  (that  player  is controled by  a  human  using  the 
joystick indicated).  The colour of the text is the same as the  colour 
of the player's line.  You can have a game consisting of no humans just 
to  watch how the game can be played.  When you are playing  the  game, 
move the joystick in the direction you want the line to go.  if you let 
go of the joystick,  the line carries on in the direction it was going. 
Do  not  move  your line in the opposite direction  to  which  you  are 
currently moving as that will crash it. When your line crashes, it dies 
and becomes a darker colour.  On the title screen,  there is an  option 
that can be toggled by pressing F9 (if you don't want to press F9,  get 
your  mother to do it for you!).  Either you can crash into dead  lines 
(ALL  LINES  KILL) or you can go over them (DEAD LINES  SAFE).  On  the 
title screen, pressing keys 1-0 selects the speed. 0 is the fastest and 
9 is the slowest.  The computer functions just as well at each speed so 
it  is more difficult at speed 0 for humans.
Pressing repeatedly on The + and - keys  on  the 
numeric keypad ajust the vertical size of the arena.  In fact, using an 
overscan  routine,  it is possible to have sizes greater than 200  (you 
can  tell  when  overscan  is going to be used  as  the  numbers  start 
flashing).  The  overscan  is not perfect and has the  nasty  habit  of 
restoring the screen to normal size.  If this happens, press F10 during 
the  game.  This  is likely to happen when you press a key  during  the 
game,  or  have anything plugged into the standard joystickports  (even 
mice that cannot keep still). As a general rule, only have screen sizes 
greater  than 200 if you are not using the two  standard  joystickports 
(use the STE's and the paralell ones instead).  While playing the game, 
press Q to quit and W to return to the desktop.
    For  those  of you interested,  the effect on  the  LINECRASH  logo 
resembles an effect often seen on the 8 bit Ataris (On STFMs,  you  can 
see 128 colours, and STE owners can see in 256 colours). 
   In the same folder, there is a file called LINEC16P.BAS. This is not 
the complete sourcecode,  but is a miniature six player version of this 
game (You cannot use the paralell joysticks)  You have to  continuously 
move the joystick (including just before the start), otherwise you will 
crash. The amazing thing about it  is  that  it was written in only one
line of STOS Basic!!! (it requires the STE extension).

UPDATE 17-04-94

I have heard that if you run this game on a machine with 4 
megabytes, it crashes frequently. If you use a software memory 
emulator, or that program that STE owners use to avoid 2.5 
megabyte STEs thinking that they are 4 megabyte STEs. I have
heard a rumour about a patch program that fixes this bug for
4-meg STs. If you can get it, use it.
This program has been updated with STOS FIX 3 to make it run on
STs with TOS>1.62 If you are still having trouble trying to get
this game to work on your TOS, use a program called STSFX27A.
