   In case you're wondering why this game is called 3D SKI when 
everything is in 2D, it is because

1. It rhymes
2. I couldn't be bothered to prevent the sprites look as if they 
were about to fall off the screen.
3. There is no point 3.

   This game was originally a sub-game within Battlepod, Wacko 
Software's entry for the 1989 STOS Gameswriter of the year 
contest (and the only game worked on bt all members of Wacko 
Software). The original game took two disks and was as 
interesting to play as having a chemistry lesson from Mr.B. If 
you managed to stay awake long enough, you would find a trading 
post, and only then, the chances of playing this subgame were 
50/50. It is this sub-game, 3D Ski which I have extracted and put 
on this disk.

   The idea is that you are in charge of an egotistical robot. 
When he was asked if he wanted to do something dangerous, he said 
yes, but said it as a joke, and ended up on the Ski slope. At the 
time you start, he just cannot help looking at his fans. You 
start by moving the joystick forwards when you hear the gun (if 
you do it before, it's a false start). In case you are wondering 
where on earth you can find such a ski slope, this is because 
it's not on earth (another leftover from Battlepod). On the right 
is a green dot which you control. Control is relatively simple 
(that is, if you know what a joystick is). Move left or right and 
the dot will do just that. Pressing the fire button will make you 
go fater, your dot will disapear and the robot will look at his 
fans rather than pay attention to the slope ahead. You will get 
extra points for doing this. I'm not exactly sure about the 
scoring system as it's been nearly two years since I wrote this 
game. There are two invisible opponents, who'se progress is 
indicated by their scores (I'm not sure how this works). You die 
when you fall off or colide with a rock. It is somehow possible 
to change the file LV1.MBK so that you may design your own 
tracks. Perhaps, I will release the construction kit.

Credits :
Andrei Ellman : Erm, everything really (except the rock which was
drawn by Patrick)
Patrick Montgomery : See above
Kris Tooke : Absolutley nothing (as usual), however, he did draw 
a few things for the rest of the Battlepod game.

Debits :
School (AAAARRRRRGGGHHH!!!!!!)

   If I hear enough requests to write an improved version of this 
game, I might release one. Also If you want a copy of my original 
Battleopd game, then it is available on two single sided (or one 
double sided) disk(s). I can be contacted at the following address:

P.S. And oh yes, have you tried out the STOS Rewriter yet? 
(currently at version 1.02f).

P.P.S. We also run a PD Library (Wacko PD). For a catalog, send 
us a blank disk.
