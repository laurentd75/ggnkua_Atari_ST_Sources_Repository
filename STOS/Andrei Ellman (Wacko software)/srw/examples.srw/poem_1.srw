        N1s

I V1PAS A1 as a N2
That V2PREs B1 P1 N3s and N4s,
When all at once I V3PAS a N5,
a N6 of A2 N1s;
P2 the N7, P3 the N8,
V4PREing and V5PREing P4 the N9.

B1 as the N10s that V6PRE
and V7PRE P5 L1
They V8PAS P6 a never-V9PREing N11
P7 the N12 of a N13:
Ten thousand V3PAS I P8 a N14,
V10PREing their N15s in A3 N16.

The N17s P9 them V11PAS, but they
Out-V12PAS the A4 N17s in A5ness:
a N18 could not but be A6,
In such a A7 N19:
I V13PAS - and V13PAS - but A8 N20
What N21 the N22 to me had V14PER:

For oft, when on my N23 I V15PRE
In A9 or in A10 mood,
They V16PRE P10 that A11 N24
Which is the N25 of N26;
and then my N27 with N28 V17PREs
and V11PREs P11 the N1s
