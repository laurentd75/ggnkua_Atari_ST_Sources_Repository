Dear M2,
    Ten A1 days ago, you B1 sent me your super-A2 A3 A4 N1. It said 
in the A5 advert that it could V1PRE up to seven A6 N2s in one day.
This seemed A7, until I V2PAS it P1 M3. Firstly, its A8 N3 fell 
off. This was probarbly due to the A9 fact that M3's N4 was A10,
rather than A11. but when the N5 V2PAS P2 the A12 N6, things were 
B2 begining to look A13. The A14 N7 then V3PAS P3 the A15 N8s and 
N9s. They now have the A16 habbit of V4PREing P4 the N10 and its 
N11s. Due to this, I now think of myself as the A17 N12 of L1. 
Could you please V5PRE me and send me a new N1.

Yours B3,

 ( M1 )

ps. The N10's N11s are now begining to look like a A18 N13.
