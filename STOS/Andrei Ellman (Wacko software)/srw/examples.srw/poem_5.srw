         The N1 and the N2-N3

The N1 and the N2-N3 went to L1
P1 a A1 N4-A2 N5,
They V1PAS some N6s, and plenty of N7s,
V2PER P2 a five-N8 N9.
The N1 V3PAS P3 the N10s P4,
and V4PAS P5 a A3 N11,
'O A4 N2! O N2, my N12,
What a A5 N2 you are,
    You are,
    You are!
What a A5 N2 you are!'

N2 said to the N1, 'You A6 N13!
How B1 A7 you V4PRE!
O let us get V5PER! too long we have V6PER:
but what shall we V6PRE P6 a N14?'
They V7PAS for a year and a day,
To the land where the N15 V8PREs,
and there P7 a N16, a N17 V9PAS,
With a N14 at the N18 of his N19,
    His N19,
    His N19,
With a N14 at the N18 of his N19.

'A8 N17, are you V10PREing to V11PRE P8 one N20
Your N14?' said the N17, 'I will.'
So they V1PAS it P9, and were V5PER next day
P10 the N21 who V12PREs on the N22.
They V13PAS P11 N23s, and N24s of N25,
Which they V14PAS P10 a A9 N26;
and N27 P10 N27, on the N28 of the N29,
They V15PAS P11 the N30 of the N31,
    The N31,
    The N31,
They V15PAS P11 the N30 of the N31.
