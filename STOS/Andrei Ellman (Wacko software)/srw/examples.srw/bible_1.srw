In the N1, N2 V1PAS the N3s and the N4. now the N4 was A1 and A2, A3ness was
P1the N5 of the N6, and the N7 of N2 was V2PREing P1 the N8s.

and N2 said "let there be N9", and there was N9. N2 saw that the N9 was A4,
and he V3PAS the N9 P2 the A3ness. N2 called the N9 "N10", and the A3ness
he called "N11". and there was N12, and there was N13 - the first N10.

and N2 said "let there be a N14 P3 the the N8s to V3PRE N8 P2 N8." so N2 V4PAS
the N14 and V3PAS the N8 P4 the N14 P2 the N8 P5 it. and it was so. N2 called
the N14 "N15", and there was N12, and there was N13 - the second N10

and N2 said "let the N8 P4 the N15 be V5PAS to one N16, and let A5 N17 V6PRE."
and it was so. N2 called the A5 N17 "N18", and the V5PER N8s he called "N19s".
and N2 saw that it was A4.
   then N2 said "let the N18 V7PRE N20: N21-V8PREing N22s and N23s on the N18
that V8PRE N24 P6 N21 P7 it, V9PREing to their A6 N25s." and it was so. the
N18 V7PAS N20: N22s V8PREing N21 V9PREing to their N25s, and N23s V8PREing N24
P6 N21 V9PREing. and N2 saw that it was A4. and there was N12, and there was
N13 - the third N10

and N2 said "let there be N9s P7 the N14 of the N15 to V3PRE the N10 P2 the
N11, and let them serve as N26s to V10PRE N27s and N10s and N28s, and let
them be N9s P7 the N14 of N16 to V11PRE N9 P7 the N4." and it was so.
N2 V4PAS two A7 N9s - the A7er N9 to V12PRE the N10 and the A8er N9 to
V12PRE the N11. he also V4PAS the N29s. N2 V13PAS them P8 the N14 P9
the N15 to V11PRE N9 P10 the N4, to V14PAS the N10 and the N11, and to
V3PRE the N9 from the A3ness. and N2 saw that it was A4. and there was
N12 and there was N13 - the fourth N10

and N2 said "let the N8 V15PRE P11 A9 N30s, and let N31s V16PRE P5 the N4 P4
the N14 P9 the N15." so N2 V1PAS the A7 N30s P9 the N19 and every A9 and
V17PREing N32 P11 which the N8 V15PREs, V9PREing to their N25s, and every A10
N31 V9PREing to its N25. And N2 saw that it was A4. N2 V16PAS them and said
"be A11 and V18PRE in N33 and V19PRE the N8 P7 the N19s, and let the N31s
V18PRE P10 the N4." And there was N12 and there was N13 - the fifth N10

and N2 said "let the N18 V7PRE A9 N30s, V9PREing to their N25s: N34, N30s that
V17PRE P12 the N17, and A12 N35, each V9PREing to its N25." and it was so. N2
V4PAS the A12 N35s V9PREing to their N25s, the N34 V9PREing to their N25s. And
N2 saw that it was A4.
   then N2 said "let us V4PRE N36 P7 our N37, P7 our N38, and let them V20PRE
P1 the N39s P9 the N19 and the N31s P9 the N40 , P1 the N34, P1 all the N4,
and P1 all the N30s that V17PRE P17 the N17."
so N2 N1PAS N36 P7 his own N37, P7 the N37 of N2, he V1PAS him; A13 and A14,
he V1PAS them.
   N2 V21PAS them and said to them, "be A11 and V18PRE P7 N33; V19PRE the N4
and V22PRE it. V20PRE P1 the N39s P9 the N19 and the N31s P9 the N40 and P1
every A9 N30 that V17PREs P10 the N17."
   Then N2 said "i V11PRE you every N21-V28PREing N22 P10 the N41 P9 the N4
and every N23 that has N24 with N21 P7 it. they will be yours for N42. and to
all the N43s P9 the N4 and all the N31s P9 the N49 and all the N30s that V9PRE
P19 the N17 - everything that has the N44 P9 N45 P7 it - i V11PRE every A15
N22 for N42." and it was so.
   N2 saw all that he had V4PAS, and it was very A4. And there was N12, and
