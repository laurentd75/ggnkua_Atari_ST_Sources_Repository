             The History of N1s.

   at first, you would think that a A1 alternative title for this
A2 book would be : "The A3 history of A4 N1s". However, as you B1
read further, you begin to feel A5.
   It all begins with a load of N2s. These A6 N2s were B2 feeling 
A7, so they decided to V1PRE A8 N3s B3. This made some of the N2s 
turn into N4s, but the rest became A9 N1s. This gave them the A10 
ability to V2PRE P1 their N5's N6. although they had the problem 
of not being able to V2PRE P1 A11 N5s, they soon overcame this 
when they learned to V3PRE. at first, they did this rather B4, 
but as time went on, they V3PAS B5. They made N7s as A12 as a N8 
to keep them B6 A13. This seemed A14 as a N9 until the V4PREing 
N10s V5PAS P2 their N11s. They all V6PAS B7 V7PER N12s P3 their 
A15 A16 N13s. What B8 happened next involved a A17 V8PER N14 
which was V9PER.
   The rest of this A18 book will be so unV10PER that it would be 
better if I V11PAS a A19 N15 instead.

A20ness : #   A21ness : #   A22ness : #.#   A23ness : #

bottom line :
   
This book would B9 want to make you V12PRE yourself. I could but not 
help notice how A24 this A25 book was to read. It would want to make 
you B9 say :"Oh my A26 god, I think I'm going to V13PRE!" 
Try reading "N16s, the N17s of the future" instead. and 
remember, a N18 a day keeps the A27 N19 away.
