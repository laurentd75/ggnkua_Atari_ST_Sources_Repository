   The purpouse of a A1 N1 is to provide N2s with the N3s and N4s 
that they want to V1PRE. It satisfies their N5s. anything that 
satisfies a N5, whether it is a A2 N6 or a V2PREing lesson, has 
A3ness. The extent of this A4 A3ness varies according to N7s. For 
example, the A3ness of a A5 N8 P1 a A6 part of a N9 is A7er to a 
N10less N11 than it is to a A8 N12 P2 a A9 N13 P2 a A10 A11 N14. 
The A3ness of a A12 N15 P3 the N16 is A13er than it is P3 the 
N17. The A3ness of any N17 or N4, therefore, depends on the 
demand for it at any A4 time by any A14 N2.
   The A3ness of a N17 or N4 to a A14 N2 will V3PRE - or V4PRE, 
according to the number of units of thet N17 that he has. If he 
does not have any N18s, the A3ness of a single pair of N18s will 
be A15. If he allready has a pair of N18s, then the A3ness of a 
second pair will be A16er than the first. The A3ness of a third 
pair of N18s will be A16er than the second and so on. This A17 
V4PREation of a N17's A3ness is known as the law of V5PREing 
A3ness.
   There will B1 B2 come a time when a N11 does not want to spend 
money on yet another pair of N18s. If he has four pairs already, 
say, then he would B3 rather spend his money on a N19, rather 
than a fifth pair of N18s (unless, of course, he already had a 
N20 full of N19s!). The point at which he V6PREs his final pair of 
N18s, in this case after he has V6PER the fourth pair, is the 
N21, and we say that this unit of the N17 - the fourth - has A18 
A3ness.
   The unit which has A18 A3ness may be the first or the 
milionth. For most N2s, for example, the first N22 they V6PRE is 
P4 the N23. They do not want more than one.
   In every A1 N1 the N24 V7PREs the A3ness, as far as he is 
concerned, of all the N17s and N4s available. Firstly, he must 
decide how many, or how much of each, he requires. It is when he 
decides on these quantities that he applies the law of V5PREing 
A3ness.
   Whenever we V6PRE something, we considder it's A3ness in 
relation to it's N25. For example, to the N24, the A3ness of four 
N26s at 50p is probarbly A19er than the A3ness of one N27 at 50p. 
However, if he or she has 250p to spend on N28s, it is unlikley 
that twenty N26s and no N27s will be V6PER. Eight N26s for 100p 
and three N27s for 150p might be a A20er choice. In this case, 
the eighth N26 would have A18 A3ness. It can be B4 V8PER, 
therefore, that the A18 A3ness of a N17 can be V9PER by it's N25. 
at the same time, there comes a point where no matter how A20 the 
N25 of a N17, the A18 A3ness of that N17 to a particular N2 
remains unV10PER. There is a limit, for example, to the amount of 
N28s a N2 can V11PRE, or N29s he or she can V12PRE. Even if N28s 
and N29s were A21, N2s would not spend their entire lives 
V11PREing N26s and V12PREing N29s!
