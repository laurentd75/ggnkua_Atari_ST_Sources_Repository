    The differences between N1s and N2s.

   What's A1er than a N3, has more N4s than a N5, and is B1 more 
A2 than a A3 N6. no, it's not another A4 attemt by the church of 
N7s to V1PRE N8s, nor is it an item from a A5 story by M1, "the 
human N9". In fact, these are all A6 N1s. but wait, doesn't the 
same apply for N2s? by using M2's A7 N10 logic, we could prove 
that they are the same, but they're not.
   For a start, a typical N1 has a lot more A8 N11s than a N2. 
This fact once featured in a song by "The A9 N12s" : a A10 
popgroup from L1 consisting of "mc N13" and "dj N14", otherwise
known as the "A11 duo". One of them even went on to B2 become labour's
A12 minister of V2PER N15s.
It was once discovered in L2 that there was a lost tribe of N16s who B3
had the habit of V3PREing P1 their N2s. They loved N2s so much that 
they had them V4PRE B4 as a N17. They only thought of N1s as A13 
N18s. It is a A14 tradition for a N16 to say "Holy N19!" every 
time they see a N1 P2 a N2, or a N20 P3 the A15 N21. They also have the
habit of V5PREing their N22s B5. This gives them their A16 expression :
"a N1 that V6PREs is like a N2 P4 a N23.
   as far as we B6 know, this and the fact that N1s are A17er than N2s
are B7 the only A18 differences between N1s and N2s.
