       A1 N1s and N2s

In A2 N3s there are A3 N4s of N5,
When all N6s V1PRE
To V2PRE their N7s P1 and V3PRE.
It's one of those N8s that the A4est N9s V4PRE,
because the N10 is much too A5
and one must V5PRE its A6 A7 N11...
The N12s V6PRE when the A8 N13s V7PRE their N14s,
because they're B1 B2 A9!

A1 N1s and N2s
V8PRE P2 the A10 N10.
The N15s don't care to,
The N16s wouldn't dare to,
N17s and N18s V9PRE B3 from twelve to one,
but N2s V10PRE a
N18.
In L1 there are A11 N20s
To protect you from the N21.
In L2 there are N22s like N23s
Which the N2s won't V11PRE.

at twelve noon
The N12s V12PRE
and no A12 N24 is V13PER
but A1 N1s and N2s
V8PRE P2 the A10 N10.

It's such a surprise for A13 N25s to V14PRE,
That though the N2s are A14
They're quite impervious to A15ness.
When the A8 N13s V15PREs every N12 V16PREs in glee,
because the A16 N26s hope he
Will V17PRE his A17 N27 P3 a N28...
It seems such a shame when the N2s V18PRE the N29
That they gave rise to such A18ness and A19ness.

A1 N1s and N2s
V8PRE P2 the A10 N10.
The A20est A21 N30
Can never understand it.
In L3 the N31 of N32
Is just what the N12s V19PRE.
They put their N33 or N34 down
and V20PRE
In a A22 N35
Where the N10 V21PREs
To the N36 of N13 and N37
The A23 N38
Of the A23 N39
B4 gets a bit more V22PER
In L4
at twelve o'clock
They V23PRE P4 the N40,
but A1 N1s and N2s
V8PRE P2 the A10 N10.

A1 N1s and N2s
V8PRE P2 the A10 N10.
The A24est A25 N41
V24PREs this A26 N42.
In L5
They V25PRE a N43
and V26PRE P5 a A27 N44,
To V27PRE each N45
Who's A28.
In the A29 N46s
Where the N47 V28PREs
There is A30ness from twelve to two.
Even N48s
V29PRE and V30PRE,
For there's nothing else to do,
In L6
To V31PRE at all
Is seldom, if ever done,
but A1 N1s and N2s
V8PRE P2 the A10 N10.
