The A1 N1 to his N2
by M1

Come V1PRE P1 me and be my N3;
and we will all the N4s V2PRE
That N5s and N6s, N7s and N8s,
N9s or A2 N10 V3PREs.

and we will V4PRE P2 the N11s,
and see the N12s V5PRE their N13s
P3 A3 N14s, to whose falls A4
N15s V6PRE N16s.

and I will make thee N17s of N18s,
and a thousand A5 N19s;
a N20 of N21s, and a N22
V7PER all P4 N23s of N24;

a N25 made of the A6est N26
Which P5 our A7 N27s we V8PRE;
B1 V9PER N28s for the N29,
With N30s of the A9est N31;

a N32 of A10 and A11 N33s,
With A12 N34s and A13 N35s:
and if these N36s may thee V10PRE,
Come V1PRE P1 me and be my N3.

The N12's N37s shall V11PRE and V12PRE
For thy V13PRE each may morning:
If these V13PREations thy N38 may V10PRE,
Then V1PRE P1 me and be my N3.
