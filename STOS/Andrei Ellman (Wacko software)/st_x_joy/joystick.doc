26-09-92   The following will explain to you how to  use the extra joysticks
and  how to  build  them yourselves.  You might be able to find some  people
selling these things complete. 

    The 2 extra joysticks that plug into the centronics printer  port,  also 
known as a paralell joystic interface.  N.B.  this adaptor may also be  used 
with games such as Leatherneck,  Gauntlet 2,  and Projectyle to access those 
extra  players.  The file PAR_JOY.ASC contains the STOS basic sourcecode  on 
how to use this adaptor in your own games. As it is in ASCII, it can easilly 
be adapted for other basics,  or even machuine code.  This method of reading 
the joysticks has,  for some strange reason,  the habit of screwing up  both 
diskdrives, so make sure all your data is loaded before you use it, and also 
when testing,  make sure you have saved your program first.  The  diskdrives 
are restored to normal when you reboot the computer.

Parts required : 1 x 25-pin male D type plug
                 2 x 9-pin male D type plug
                 Enough wire for 12 connections.
                 Optionally, you can get covers for the adaptor.

The  pin numbers are sometimes written on the back,  if they are not  there, 
then the numbers are if you are looking at the inside of the  plug.  Connect 
the wires up in the way shown. When the wires cross (ö) they do not connect.

   Have you ever stared at the left side of your STE,  and wondered what the 
hell  you are meant to do with those two unusuall ports at the  side?  Well, 
you  can  stop staying up all night and  wonder,  and  instead,  build  this 
adaptor  to  allow you to plug normal joysticks in them  and  play any  game 
that uses the STE's extra ports for joysticks.  I have included a STOS basic
listing (STE_JOY.ASC) which can be examined, used in your  own programs, and
it can easily be  converted to machine code.  If you  have the STE extension
for  STOS by Asa Burrows,  then it has some  commands for reading  the STE's
extra joysticks, making STE_JOY.ASC unnescersary.
N.B.  this shows how to make one  adaptor for two  joysticks. Do exactly the
same for the second one.  Also, the listing does not  affect the  diskdrives
like the previous one did.


Parts required : 1 x 15 pin D plug
                 2 x 9 pin D plug
                 Enough wire for 14 connections.

N.B. the pin numbers are printed on the plugs in most cases.
