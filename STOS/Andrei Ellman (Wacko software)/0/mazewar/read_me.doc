                           MAZEWAR ST
               By Andrei Ellman of Wacko Software
                       Written using STOS

   The object of this game is simple,  just shoot your opponents. 
This game is an improved version of the Atari 8 bit game Mazewar. 
The  object  was to negotiate your way around a  maze  and  shoot 
anything blocking the path between you and your opponents. If you 
shot a wall,  an explosion was given off in three directions  and 
anybody standing too close would get blown up.  A maximum of four 
players could take part.  However,  on the Atari XLs, there were
only two joystick ports,  so only two humans could take part 
simultaneously.

   The ST Version has the following additions :
+    Some walls need to be shot more than once (the bricks are
coloured in according to how much each wall segment needs to be shot).
+    Some walls are totally indestructable.
+    The  proportion of indestructable blocks can be set  in  the 
menu. 0 meaning no blocks are indestructable and 9 menaing all of 
them are (in this case, there is only one possible route from one 
part of the maze to the other)
+    When a tank is shot,  this leaves behind a grave which  when 
shot  gives off an explosion.  (N.B.  some graves can be shot  at 
many times before they dissappear.)
+    As well as the two joysticks available on the standard STFM, 
you  can  make use of the four joystick adaptor that  works  with 
games such as Leatherneck, Gauntlet 2 and Projectyle. And if that 
wasn't  all,  STE owners can make use of those two ports  on  the 
sides  to  add  up to four joysticks,  giving a  total  of  EIGHT 
players.

   On the titlescreen,  you can select how many players are human 
and which controler they are using.  Keys F1-F8 can (de)select  a 
human player.  (N.b.  If all players are computer controled,  the 
demo  mode  will  automatically  start.  Keys F9-F10  change  the 
proportion of blocks which are indestructable (N.B.  The computer 
controlled  players play best when this factor is close or  equal 
to zero).  Keys A & S change the maximum score which a player can 
get  before he/she/it can win (in steps of 1000).  Keys T  and  Y 
change the timelimit in steps of 12.  One unit is about 2.6 secs. 
24  units is one minute.  692 is half an hour and the maximum  is 
1440 (about an hour). For the players to start, all human players 
must  enter  their names by moving the joystick up  and  down  to 
select  a letter and left and right to select a position  in  the 
name and fire when they have finished. 

   Before the game begins, you will have to wait 30 seconds for the
maze to be drawn (If you  think that is long, my original mazedraw
algorithm took 8:30 minutes to work (Isn't that a-maze-ing (sorry,
couldn't resist!))). Press P to pause the game and O to resume. The
game will end in any of the following ways :

   + The time will run out.
   + One of the player's scores exceeds the maximum score.
   + You press Q to quit.
   + You  suddenly realise that there's that  program on  TV  you 
     should be watching instead of playing this game and you turn
     off the computer by mistake.

HINT : If you are playing with a low number of human players, it 
is best that the humans work as a team, but you could also see 
who gets the best score out of the humans.

   If you like this program, you should send me a donation to 
encourage me to write more. If your donation is 5 pounds or 
greater (~15 guilders). Then you will recieve a disk containing 
the complete STOS sourcecode. Donations can be made in pounds or 
goulders. Even if you do not wish to donate any of your hard (or 
otherwise) earned money, you could just send me some comments, or 
ideas for future versions.
