PACMEN, another 8-player game by Wacko Software.

This is a game similar to Pacman with two major differences.

1. Up to eight players can play simultaneously (two from the 
regular joystick ports, two using the printer-joystick adaptor, 
and if you have an STE, another four using those ports on the 
sides (Instructions on how to build the nescesary adaptors are 
included)). Any non-human players can either be controled by the 
computer, or completely switched off.

2. Each player has infinate lives. The game ends when all dots 
are eaten, and the winner is the person with the highest score. 
Some scores that may seem ridiculously high are in fact a poor 
attempt to display negative numbers (this program is Free 
remember). You have missiles as well. Press/hold fire to launch 
your missile. Holding fire lets you control your missile with the 
joystick, and not holding fire ( = the joystick button) lets you 
control your pacman. You can shoot other players, their missiles, 
and ghosts when they are edible (light blue). When they are 
inedible (dark blue), they kill the missiles as well as the 
pacmen. If your missile is destroyed, you can launch another.

On the title screen, press keys F1-8 to select/de-select the 
players (they can be either COMPUTER controlled, HUMAN controlled 
or turned OFF. The corresponding joystick is displayed next to 
the player. (To find out how to build adaptors to add the extra 
joysticks to your ST, read the file JOYSTICK.DOC).
Press SPACE to begin the game. When you get to the GAME OVER 
screen, press SPACE to return to the title screen.

This program is Freeware. If you have any comments, send them by 
e-mail or snail-mail to the adress given at the end of this doc.
If I recieve enough comments, I might add a few more things to 
the game, add an intro and write a sillier DOC file. I would like 
to hear from as many users of this game as possible, as I hate 
writing games and throwing them into a void of emptiness.

This game should work on all known versions of TOS. Some of my 
other Programs I have written have been fixed with a utility by 
M.J. Horwell to run on STs with TOS versions greater than 1.62.
These can be downloaded from the Internet by FTP from 
atari.archive.umich.edu . Beware of any of my games that do not 
run on the newer TOSses, get the recompiled ones from 
atari.archive.umich.edu.
