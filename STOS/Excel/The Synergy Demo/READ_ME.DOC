YEEEAAAHHH!!!!
Exel at the keyboard once again.This is the README file and must NOT be
seperated from the rest of the demo.

SYNERGY requires a 520 ST(E)
                 a colour monitor or TV
             and a double sided drive

It was created on a 1040 STFM using STOS, the STOS compiler, DPaint, DEVPAC 2,
Mastersound 2, Noisetracker, Crackin' Music 2, UVK, FCOPY III and ACOPY.

This demo is PUBLIC DOMAIN.Although not in the league of the Lost Boys and
their ilk, I hope you enjoy, and inspired to code yourself, by my latest opus.

If you program in STOS or can draw a little,get in touch with me TODAY!!!!!

the Glasgow address is October to June
