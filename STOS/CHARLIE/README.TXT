THIS IS MY FIRST ATTEMPT TO WRITE ANYTHING ON THE ATARI STE COM- 
PUTER NOW THAT I HAVE RETIRED.I WILL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT IT IS A 
BIT PATHETIC BUT THE BRAIN IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE. IT IS WRIT- 
TEN FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO FANCY A SMALL FLUTTER BUT THERE IS NO 
GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL WIN AT ANY TIME. I FIRST WROTE THIS ON THE 
ATARI 800 XL AND SO FAR THIS YEAR IT HAS WON NINE TIMES. MIND YOU 
IT WAS ONLY A TENNER A TIME BUT THAT IS BETTER THAN NOTHING. SINCE 
I HAVE HAD IT RUNNING ON THE STE,NOT A SAUSAGE,BUT I HOPE I WILL 
HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO TEST IT BEFORE I GO TO MY FINAL RESTING 
PLACE. IF YOU WANT TO TRY I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK.

TO RUN THIS PROGRAMME YOU WILL FIRST HAVE TO LOAD UP STOS AND THEN 
LOAD "LOTTERY,BAS". I HAVE TRIED TO COMPILE THIS TO MAKE A STAND 
ALONE PROGRAMME BUT THE COMPILER WILL NOT HAVE IT. WHEN YOU RUN IT 
YOU WILL SEE A MENU LINE. IF YOU PUT THE MOUSE POINTER ON 'ACTION' 
YOU WILL GET A HELP MENU. CLICK ON THIS AND THE INSTRUCTIONS WILL 
COME UP ON THE SCREEN. 

A WORD OF WARNING . ONCE YOU HAVE MADE A SELECTION THE NUMBERS ARE 
REMOVED FROM THE STACK AND CANNOT BE RE-GENERATED. YOU MAY TRY IF 
YOU LIKE BUT YOU WILL FINISH UP VERY FRUSTRATED WHEN THE COMPUTER 
HANGS. THIS IS DELIBERATE TO PREVENT YOU FROM GENERATING A NEW SET 
OF NUMBERS UNTIL YOU GET ONE YOU LIKE. ON THE TWELVE AND FIFTEEN 
NUMBER PERMS YOU CAN IGNORE THE NUMBERS GENERATED AND TYPE IN YOUR 
OWN LUCKY NUMBERS STARTING FROM THE SMALLEST TO THE LARGEST AND 
THE PROGRAMME WILL DO THE PERM FOR YOU. IN CONCLUSION I WOULD LIKE 
TO THANK THE ANONYMOUS STOS EXPERT WHO GAVE ME THE ANSWER TO THE 
NUMBER GENERATING ROUTINE.

                      BEST OF LUCK

                        CHARLIE.
