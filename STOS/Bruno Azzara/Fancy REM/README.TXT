Welcome to Flashy Program Listings.


Are you bored with those REM statements, well this is where this
program comes to the rescue. You will be able to add effects such 
as reverse, shaded and underline text to the REM statements. An extra
feature is that you can create `Line 0` anywhere in your programs and 
the great thing is they can't be deleted, great for copyright stuff.

Check out the example programs to see how to use this program.



Enjoy
