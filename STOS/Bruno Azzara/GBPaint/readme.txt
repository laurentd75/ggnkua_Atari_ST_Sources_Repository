Welcome to GBPaint a complete Art package for STOS.

To create new fonts for GBPaint use the fonts.acb program on this disk
once you have created a new font  save it with the 'Save .GBF' option.
You can load .GBF font into  this  accessory  so  that you are able to
modify it in some way. You must  be  in low res before the .GBF option
becomes available.


I hope you will enjoy using GBPaint has  much as I did writing it.
