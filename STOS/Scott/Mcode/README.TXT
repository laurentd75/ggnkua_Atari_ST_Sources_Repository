All the files in this package are written in 100% machine code and
assembled with DEVPAC2.  Example *.BAS files have been included for
all the programs except XOR.PRG, which works exactly the same as
OR.PRG.

Some of the files have datascreens included, just for effect, and one,
OR.BAS needs the STAR extension installed to see the effect I wanted
to create.

To load the programs into your own STOS efforts use the following line
typed directly into the editor..., 

load "program.PRG",14     [ now hit RETURN ]

There is no need to reserve the memory bank first, as STOS does this
automatically.  

These machine code programs are 100% compiler compatable, so you can
load them up and forget about them as far as that goes.
