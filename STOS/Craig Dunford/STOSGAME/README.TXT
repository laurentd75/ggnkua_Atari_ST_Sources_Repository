OK,so I know these progs aren't anything special but seeing as I'm 
only 13 they can't be too bad.

Collide.I wrote this prog for my own use all that it does is ask you 
for 2 sprite numbers and allows your to move the sprite number you 
choose with the joystick and press fire to get the binary nu- ber 
for the collision.

Match 'em up.This is just a snap game for 2 players each player has 
his/her own key if he/she(can't be sexist can we now!)presses it when 
a matching pair appear then that player gets an extra point if he/she 
presses it when an odd pair appear then that player gets a point deducted.

Shootin' Shack.This is a simple target game where you shoot bott- 
les that randomly appear on the screen.

Most of the progs on this disk have been written to use the maes- 
tro commands if you don't have the maestro extenshion installed then 
you can delete all of the samplay,sound init commands etc to make 
it compatible.
Feel free to modify the code and muck about with it(change the graphics,sound,coding,or 
even rewrite the progs if you like)

If you have a modem and any interesting ideas or anything else for 
that matter
you can contact me through System ST on 0533 413443.
