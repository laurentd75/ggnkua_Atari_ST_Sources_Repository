   NOTE: Please ignore any references to the TEST program. Use the 
   EDITOR.BAS file instead.
    
   Its seems there were a few problems with the orignal SGAC so we  have 
   got  together  to do a complete re-write of  it.  All  graphics  have 
   re-designed  by  Tony  Gooding  (Tonesoft)  and  the  code  has  been 
   completely changed round by myself (Deano).

   Due to the fact that nobody registered for this package it is 
   now PD. This means you can copy it for everybody. Please ignore 
   any references to shareware or licenceware in the manual as 
   this disk contains the full uncut version of SGAC. PDL's who 
   stock SGAC are welcome to include this version on their list.
   
   If  you are a user of the old version then its important  to  realise 
   that  because of the changes you must read the amended manual to  see 
   the changes.  The creator program now operates from the keyboard  and 
   the listing program is now called EDITOR.BAS.  The frame picture  has 
   gone so now the full screen is used for your graphics.

   The  option  box has been replaced by a window box in order  to  make 
   this package compatible with TOS 2.06.  Now moving the mouse  pointer 
   over a word will cause it to highlight, you can now select it.
   
   TOS 2.06 owners

   Although the rest of the package works fine there is a problem 
   for TOS 2.06 users. The creator program (in the AUTO folder) 
   will not work under this version of TOS. The answer is to use 
   the ST FIXER disk from Goodmans to update it so it will work
   on an  STE with TOS 2.06. The creator program will now load
   but when  using the zone setting options the box will not show 
   properly. There is nothing we can do about this, sorry.
   
   If you have TOS 2.06 and don't have this program then return 
   your SGAC disk to us and we'll update it for you.
   
   It states somewhere in this manual that the source for the game 
   is included but due to reasons we had to remove it. Please 
   ignore references to this game which are N/A.
