This article is just some extra help and info for beginners.

When  a  SGAC game asks you where you want to go,  it sets  up  exits 
zones  on screen.  As it uses the STOS zone command for this  purpose 
its  important to realise that when you use the mouse to create  zone 
boxs on any of these kind of options (connections,  other zones) that 
you  must first click on the top left hand corner of the part of  the 
picture where the zone is to appear,  then move the mouse only to the 
right and down or down and right and not to the left.  If you set the 
zone  from  right to left then the editor program  will  generate  an 
error. It must always be from left to right.
  
Another thing to remember is that each zone option can only allow up 
to five zones on each location because of memory limitations.

Playing  the  included  sample game Grannies  Garden  will  give  you 
helpful  tips and ideas of putting your own games together. 

The order of creating a SGAC game goes like this.

1. The Creator

This  is the program you are presented with at boot up.  By the  way, 
pressing  the  SPACE  bar will allow you to  skip  the  Silly  intro. 
Following the instructions in the manual, plan your game out on paper 
and  enter  the  information into this  program.  Once  the  code  is 
finished then save it as a GAD file onto a blank disk.


2. Pictures

As  SGAC is a graphic adventure creating package you need to have  as 
many pictures as locations. If you don't then the creator will crash. 
Draw  your  pictures using any art package and compress them  to  MBK 
files and put them on the same disk as the GAD file.

3. The TEST program.

The  test program is just a compiled version of the  editor  program, 
its used to load your GAD file and location pictures and allow you to 
play  the game to test it.  So if you spot any errors then just  load 
the GAD file back into the creator to edit it. The file TEST.PRG must 
also be copied to your disk.

Its  also  important to note that TEST program  sets  the  background 
colour to colour 15 in the picture palette and sets colour 0 as 
the pen colour.  These colours are used to show the option window  in 
the  game.  Its best to have colour 0 as the colour you  want  your 
text to be and colour 15 as the colour of the option window.

So  for  the testing.......asuming you have three locations  in  your 
test game then this lot should be on disk.
 
TEST.PRG

DATA.GAD (or whatever you called the file)

PIC1.MBK
PIC2.MBK
PIC3.MBK

The  MBK picture files are what the TEST and EDITOR programs load  as 
it goes along. So pic1.mbk appears at location one and so on.

3. THE EDITOR PROGRAM

This  program loads up your pics and GAD file and allows you to  move 
around  at do things like the test program.  This is supplied so  you 
can add the extra information needed in your game such as H_P  events 
and  your own routines.  Following the intructions in the manual  you 
add the extras and you can then compile this program and put it on  a 
disk  with  your  MBK pictures and GAD file.  You can  now  load  the 
compiled  game  and  play it.  Do not attempt to change  any  of  the 
routines in it....only add the extras where the program has a list of 
rem statements.

OTHER ROUTINES

You can actually add sprite animation to your games by doing a  gosub 
from line 500 in the editor listing.  This is used to show the  witch 
melting  in Grannies Garden.  You can put your animation info in  the 
game as such.

9000 if LOCATION=4 then sprite 1,80,100,1 : anim 1,"(1,5)(2,5)(3,5)"L 
     : anim on : return
 
There are plenty of ideas you can use.  Your imagination is the  only 
limit. So why not write a classic adventure today.

UPDATE:

Note it is important to remember that when you enter any text 
discriptions into the creator that the text appears as it is 
typed, in other words the creator does'nt have a text formatting 
option in it so type the text as you wish to see it in the game.
