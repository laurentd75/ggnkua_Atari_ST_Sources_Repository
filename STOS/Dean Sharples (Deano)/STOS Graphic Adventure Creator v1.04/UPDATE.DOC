     Stos Adventure Creator v1.04

     Update Details.....

Dear Registrated User

What  you have here is the latest version of SAC,  version  1.04, 
there have been a few inprovements over version 1.03 which are..

Improved Location and Game Message Menus
Improved Picture handing Options
New Delete Options on Location and Game Message Menus
A Quit to Desktop option (at last)

Note  that  any game files created with earlier versions  of  SAC 
will not load into the Creator,  they have to be converted to the 
new format using the CONVERT.BAS program on this disk.

If you load this program into STOS and run it,  you are presented 
with three options.

 1. Convert VAR to ADV.
 2. Convert ADV.
 3. Quit Program.
 
Here is what is option does.....

 Convert VAR to ADV

When Sac was first released,  it saved its data as .VAR  files, 
this  was  an horrible big chunk of code which took up a  lot  of 
memory which could be used for other things,  it also meant  that 
created adventures could'nt be compiled.

If you have the old version of Sac which saves these files,  then 
you  can  use this option to convert any VAR data  files  to  the 
latest ADV format.  Just select it and click on the VAR file  you 
want to convert, the program will load it then ask you for a name 
to  save it under,  so if your file is  called  CASTLE.VAR,  then 
enter its new name as CASTLE.ADV, and it will be saved to disk.

Note: The converted VAR file will only load into V1.04 of SAC.

 Convert ADV

If  you  have created ADV data files with versions 1.02  or  1,03 
then  you  will need to use this option to convert them  to  load 
into  v1.04 of SAC,  this is the same as the CONVERT VAR  option, 
just load the old ADV file and save it under the same name.

 Quit Program 

I have'nt a clue what this one does, try it and see.

 Location and Game Message menus

These menus have been improved for better input,  when you choose 
the   INSERT  and  AMEND  options,   you  can  now  type   longer 
descriptions and you can use the cursor keys (arrow keys) to step 
through  the text and postion the cursor anywhere on the  screen. 
You  can  also use the BACKSPACE key to delete text and  you  can 
also use the DELETE key,  just postion the cursor to the left  of 
the word you wish to delete and press DELETE,  the letter of  the 
word are erased and the others on the line are moved back.

You  can also overwrite text,  this is useful if you  typed  WEST 
instead of EAST,  just move the cursor over the W and type  EAST. 
Anyway, just mess about and see what I mean.

In the EDITOR program and your future creations, you can now turn 
the graphics on and off by entering these commands.

 "pics on", turn the graphics on
 "pics off", turn the graphics off

The Quit to Desktop option has replaced the Pictures  option,  so 
what you do now is name your pictures with the format...

 "pic+location number+.mbk"

So  the picture for Location one would be called  "pic1.mbk"  and 
the picture for location two would be called "pic2.mbk".

Put  these pictures on the disk with your data file and the  TEST 
program  will  load each picture when it comes  to  its  location 
number,  so when the game starts,  the "pic1.mbk" file will  load 
and  display itself on the screen then the  location  description 
for Location one will appear.

On line 120 of the EDITOR programs listing,  you will see a  line 
of  varibles,  at the end of the line is one called SCR which  is 
set to nought, it holds two values...

 SCR=0 : (No pictures in the game)
 SCR=1 : (Pictures in the game)

So if your game has graphics then set it to one,  otherwise leave 
it set to nought for a normal text only adventure.

One more thing to mention, the FRAME.PI1 file has now gone, as it 
is  not needed anymore,  so you can now use the whole  screen  to 
draw  your pictures,  what happens now is the game now loads  the 
picture,  pauses  for a few seconds,  then clears the screen  and 
prints  the  location description,  allowing you to  have  better 
larger pictures and location and message descriptions.

Well thats it now,  see you later,  and come on, get writing some 
SAC games and send them to me, I'll give you something back.

By the way, don't bother to try and convert the ADV files on this 
disk, I've already done them.
