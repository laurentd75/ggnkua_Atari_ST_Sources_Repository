The program called FVEDIT.PRG is a FV editor. With that program
you can test or create FV files. If you want to save the current
resolution as a FV file you just have to start the program and
press '2' for save. If you want to change something before saving
you could either press '0' for the specials menu or use the following
keys (they may also be used when viewing the test screen).

The first letter is used to increase by one and the second to decrease
by one.
