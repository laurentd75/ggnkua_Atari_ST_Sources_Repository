1    Short Introduction


With this program you can create true colour sprites for the Atari Falcon. The
stuff you require are a F030 with at least 4 megs of memory. It's now compatible
with both screen enhancers, virtual memory, mtos and strange monitors. Well
actually there are some problems with too strange monitors. If it doesn't work
with your monitor, please contact me. If you are using mtos you may access the
desktop by pressing the tab key.



2    How to use this program


2.1   Choosing colours

To pick a colour press the right button on the colour you want. You can do this
anywhere but on the buttons. To create new colours double click with the left
button on the palette you don't want anymore and you will come to the palette
creation screen. The program uses all 65000 colours.



2.2   Put me down

When you have made your sprite you can put it down into the sprite storage
area by pressing the put button (arrow down on the top row) or you could press
the arrow down key on your keyboard. To retrieve a stored sprite use the left
and right arrow to scroll until the correct sprite is in the middle of the scre*
 *en,
then press the get button or use the arrow up key.



2.3   Saving sprites

Sprites may be saved in either uncompressed or compressed format. The sprites
may also be saved as both formats at once.  This is chosen per sprite so you
might save some of your sprites uncompressed and some compressed and the
rest both.  If you want to change all sprites to the same format this can be
done in the preferences meny.  Selecting format for single sprite is done with
the symbol in the bottom right corner of the button panel. If it says 1 then the
current sprite will be saved in an uncompressed format, if it says 2 it will be
saved in a compressed format and if it says 1&2 it will be saved in both format*
 *s.
Notice that only sprites that have been put and show up in the bottom part of
the screen will be saved.
   The advantages of saving the sprites in compressed format is that they are
drawn faster and if they contain lots of black they will require less disc space
and memory than uncompressed sprites.  The drawback is that if clipping is
required the sprites they will take longer time to draw and if they don't conta*
 *in
any black then they will require more memory and disc space as well.  Since
the save method is chosen per sprite you can save the most important sprites
in both formats e.g. the shots in a shoot-em-up game.
   The sprites may also be saved as raw data. This makes the data very easy
to use, but a serious drawback is that raw data cannot be reloaded because no
information about sprite sizes etc. is saved. When saving sprites as raw data
compression is never used.

                                  2

2.4   Animation

To animate a sprite use the arrow keys to scroll to the first sprite in your
animation sequence. Then click on the pacman button and your sprite will be
animated. If the animation sequence isn't the one you want then make a right
button click on the pacman and choose Change animation sequence.



2.5   Grabbing sprites from a picture

The grab a sprite from a picture you must first load a picture. When you have
done that you may grab a sprite from it. When grabbing you shall click on the
top left corner of the part you want to grab. In the preferences you might turn
on a grid with an optional offset to make grabbing easier. This is all made from
the file menu. The following picture formats are currently supported.

   o TGA 24 bit type two Targa pictures.

   o TRP 16 bit Falcon true colour picture.

   o Raw data 16 bit Falcon true colour raw data.

   o NEO 16 colours ST Neochrome picture.

   o PI1 16 colours ST Degas Elite picture.

   o TRC Don't know what this is, but it seems to work ok!

   o GOD Godpaint 16 bit true colour picture.

All picture formats except Targa can be Ice packed (2.40). If you load raw data
you have to enter the size of picture and the offset of the picture data from t*
 *he
start of the file in bytes.



3    How do I use the sprites in my own program


If you program in assembler then you can find a sprite drawing routine
in falclib6.  If you are using STOS then you could use Anthony Jacques'
(jacquesa@cs.man.ac.uk) Falcon STOS extension which supports true colour
Spooky Sprites.  The assembler sprite drawing program is written in position
independent code and could easily be used in other languages like GFA-Basic
with very small modifications.



4    Keyboard commands


Note that the copy and paste commands can only be used from the keyboard.
Flood fill may also be used by right clicking on the Fill button.

6    History


6.1   Version 6

Faster TGA picture loading when not using dithering. Improved file selection.
A new rout for setting the vga video mode is used (I hope it works).



6.2   Version 5

The fileselctor now works properly. There was a bug when loading TRE pictures,
fixed. Proper menus at last! Mtos compatible (press tab to access the desktop).
New picture save format, 24-bit tga.  You can now load Rainbow 2 sprites.
Arrow keys are now used to scroll, get and put sprites.



6.3   Version 4

The largest change is that you can use the sprite editor in double pixel mode
(768*240) if you use a rgb monitor or tv.  The video mode is changed in the
preferences menu.  Switching between ntsc and pal on rgb now works as it's
supposed to do (you cannot do this on vga monitors). Doubling and halving of
sprite width is now implemented. This allows you to convert medium resolution
sprites to low res and vice versa. New paste mode Merge. Pictures can now be
saved in a run length encoded format. Keyboard shortcut 'e' for replace colour.
Faster sprite loading.  Flood fill added.  Can be installed as TRS application
and load sprite files automatically. You may now create a picture containing all
sprites. Some multitasking during the most time consuming operations. Lots
of minor bugs removed.



6.4   Version 3

Some new file formats supported e.g.  Neochrome and Degas Elite.  A couple
of bugs have been removed. New keyboard commands 'r' grabs a sprite from a
picture and 'space' views a loaded picture.



6.5   Version 2

A new improved sprite grabbing.  You can now load pictures that are larger
than the screen and scroll around. Loading pictures doesn't crash the virtual
memory any more. You can now paste sprites to pictures and save the pictures.
Now it's possible to save the sprites as raw data and to load raw data pictures.



6.6   Version 1

The quite buggy first version.
