Dear Peter,
          Please find enclosed my entry to the STos  competition. 
I hope that it has arrived on time,  but if not still have a look 
at.
          I  decided to convert Lode Runner,  which is one of  my 
favourites's.  I am not a professional by any means and I am not an 
artist either, but here it is.
          To play the game,  wait for the on screen instructions, 
which are the joystick commands. It is so simple, collect all the 
barrels  an  go on to the next screen,  but watch  out  for  the 
chasers,  they will get you if you stand still for to  long.  You 
can  dig  holes to drop the chasers into and they can't  get  out 
again.
  
          I  actually  ran out of time and the debugging  is  not 
complete but the game works.  You will probably notice that it is 
in medium res.  I thought it looked better and the consequence of 
that  is  that I have also converted the Map Editor  to  work  in 
medium  or  low res.(not much work to make it run in  high  res. as 
well).

          I  hope that you find the game enclosed suitable to  be 
awarded a prize (of course you do).

               your faithful SToser





               David Williams.

p.s.  There are two disks enclosed one formatted on my atari  and 
one  formatted  on my friends atari,  only because  some  atari's 
won't read my formatted disks.

on the disk are the following items:-

RUNNER.BAS
RUNNER.PRG
RUNNER.DOC

p.s.s  I have also converted 'Blockbusters','Play your cards right' and 
I have started 'Catchphrases'.  nothing sent of to anyone  except 
Blockbusters,  which  I sent to Domark about 18 months  ago,  but 
they  couldn't decide if they were going to release 16  bit  game 
shows(they have the copyright for it).
