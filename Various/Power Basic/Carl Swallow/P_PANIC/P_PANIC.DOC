HELP FILE FOR PIPE PANIC ON THE ATARI ST

All ST's, Low Resolution only.

	To load this great little game, click on P_PANIC.PRG in the
P_PANIC folder. The game was written in Fast Basic and therefore uses
Fast Basic's run time system. Once this appears, select LOAD PROGRAM
from the file menu and then, from the same menu, select RUN PROGRAM
and everything should start okey-dokey.
	The object of the game is to collect all the blue oil blobs
and are buried deep beneath the ground. Many hazards exist including
rocks that will dent your drill bit.
	Every two screen there is a bonus screen where you must
collect all the oil within a set time limit. There are fifty screens
in all. Every ten screen a code will be given which can be used to
jump to that particular screen at the start of any game. We were
going to print them but that would make things too easy wouln't it!
