M2LIB provides an ISO-M2-library, a POSIX-library and some more modules for
the  following  Modula-2  systems:  Haenisch,  Megamax,  TDI,  LPR and SPC.
Furthermore  there  are  some  utilities  for  LPR and TDI. The sources are
mixed  with  preprocessor  commands  to  allow  a portable programming. The
preprocessor  is included but there is a need of a commandline interpreter.
Because  of  the  lot of files (uncompressed ~ 4.5 MB) you will need a hard
disk.  For  the  sake  of DD disks M2LIB is divided into two archives. Both
archives are needed in order to work with M2LIB.

First read DOC\M2LIB.TXT. There you will find more information.

M2LIB is Freeware. More details are to be read in DOC\COPYING.
