M2POSIX is an attempt to implement some POSIX's system calls for
Modula-2. The sources are made for ATARI-GEMDOS with or without MiNT
(Version >= 0.96 recommended). The modules are written in a mixture of
Modula-2 and C-preprocessor instructions to allow more portable programming.
The only compilers currently supported are LPR (~SPC), Megamax,
Haenisch and TDI. To translate you need a C-preprocessor, i.e. the
GNU-C-preprocessor, which is available at any anonymous ftp area, and
is also included in this package.

A complete documentation is not yet available (a small german
description is in M2POSIX.TXT). Read the sources and the (commented)
shell scripts.

M2POSIX is freeware.
