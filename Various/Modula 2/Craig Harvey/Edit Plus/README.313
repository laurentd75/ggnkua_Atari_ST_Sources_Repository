Edit Plus v 3.13                                        30 Apr 1995
================

Edit Plus v 3.1  (The replacement for EdHak 3.0)
===============

First of all, the new name is mainly a result of popular demand.  For
those few of you who prefer the name EdHak, feel free to rename your
file as EdHak and hack the program itself to replace all the
'EDITPLUS' and 'Edit Plus' strings with corresponding EdHak
terminology.  In fact, if you currently use EdHak together with
QuickCIS, you will probably need to do some file renaming to have
QuickCIS properly find Edit Plus.


3.13              30 Apr 1995
================

1)  MUCH faster global replace operation.  It was always fast when
replacing a string with another string of the same length, but now
it is also very fast when the search and replace strings are not the
same length.  It now also displays how many total replacements were
made (in the status line just to the right of the Menu button).

The following "Fixes" fix little bugs introduced in 3.10.

2)  Fixed the cursor positioning when doing a Find/Open of disk
sectors.

3)  Fixed the Insert bytes (Alt-I) and Goto line (Alt-G) dialogs so
they do not default to putting two spaces at the start of the
requested string.

4)  Fix Printer Init dialog to allow getting rid of an existing
string, i.e., changing it to a null (blank) string.  Also fixes
the dialog to have the TXT button highlighted when it first opens
with the string showing as text.


Version 3.12   10 Sept 1994
============

All the "Fixes" listed here fix little bugs introduced in 3.1.

1)  Fixed the vert slider some more -- to make the positioning as
sensitive and accurate as it used to be.

2)  Fixed/enhanced operation with STalker...

2a)  Fixed bug in 3.10-3.11 that could crash things when capturing
from STalker.  This was related to keeping track of file size, line
numbers, etc.

2b)  Enhanced use when capturing to CAPTURE.TXT file.  It now treats
CAPTURE.TXT as one whole file, all of which is accessible with the
normal slider or key commands.  Capturing beyond the size of one Edit
Plus buffer is done by automatically appending the buffer to the disk
file.  For this to work properly, you must be sure that the disk
file starts at zero length (by saving an empty buffer as CAPTURE.TXT
before starting an on-line session).  Otherwise, Edit Plus may
either (a) not know about the part of the file on disk (and not let
you scroll back to it) or (b) if you have part of the file on disk as
well as in the buffer, when the EP buffer fills with captured text and
goes to append that to the disk file, you'll end up with duplication
of the part that was both places.  This also means that when you go to
do a final save of the CAPTURE.TXT file, you can just use the File
Save command rather than appending the buffer to the existing disk
file, which you would need to do if you your capture file is named
something else.

2c)  New Feature:  The "Paste to STeno" command from STalker now works
with Edit Plus.

3)  Fixed tracking of where you are on a disk when opening disk
sectors after having opened a file larger than the buffer.

4)  Fixed proper clearing of "Shifting..." notice after completing a
Find operation on a file larger than the buffer.

5)  Fixed unnecessary redraws when attempting to scroll up/down at
the beginning/end of a file.

6)  Fixed shift-ClrHome to put home the cursor just as ClrHome would
do with a file that takes up less than a single window.

7)  Enhanced feature:  If you are working on a file that is bigger
than the current buffer, and the last line of the buffer extends
beyond the right edge of the window, clicking the mouse on the down
arrow button while on the last line in the buffer forces the cursor to
scroll to the right all the way to the end of the line, at which point
it will shift the buffer contents to the next part of the file.  It
used to be you'd have to either page down with the mouse or use the
arrow keys to do this.


Version 3.11  31 July 1994
============

1)  Fixed the vertical slider.  After adding the capabilities listed
below, it was discovered that in some circumstances like after
merging a file, the slider would no longer know where the end of the
file was.

2)  Fixed the display following reformatting a highlighted block from
the menu command (was a bug left over from 3.0).

3)  New cursor control commands:
  Go to top of edit buffer              Ctl-UpArrow
  Go to bottom of edit buffer           Ctl-DownArrow
  Go to top of file                     Shift-Ctl-UpArrow
  Go to bottom of file                  Shift-Ctl-DownArrow
  Toggle top/bottom of edit buffer      Ctl-ClrHome
  Toggle top/bottom of file             Shift-Ctl-ClrHome
    (same as just Shift-ClrHome)


New Features in 3.10  20 July 1994
====================

1)  External modules (accessible via the Launch command).  Either of
these can also be run outside of Edit Plus.  They are NOT public
domain or freeware.  They are included as part of the Edit Plus
package, as is Diary.  They can also be distributed separately as
shareware, per the opening screen of each, which lists the
registration fee for each of them.

  a)  Sorting with QSORT11.PRG 

     This lets you sort lines of any length, each one ending with
carriage return/linefeed.  You can choose a starting line and an
ending line, but it defaults to sorting all the lines.  If launched
from Edit Plus, and the file is larger than the current Edit Plus edit
buffer size, it can only sort the lines that are currently in the
buffer.  The lines can be of different lengths, as long as the
columns you choose as sort keys occur in every line.  You are allowed
up to 3 sort key column ranges, each one either ascending or
descending.  When choosing the sort key columns, the program displays
the first line of the range being sorted to help you pick the desired
column ranges.

  b)  Encrypting with EDCRYPT.PRG

     This works the same way the old internal Encrypt command worked.
In other words, when launched from Edit Plus, it only operates on what
is in the buffer, so do not try encrypting a file that is bigger than
the buffer!  And don't encrypt something and then append it to
something else, since it will not then unencrypt properly (unless you
only use a single character as your password).  If you find
yourself wanting to encrypt files larger than the buffer, then just
run EDCRYPT.PRG separately from Edit Plus, then it will size its
encryption buffer as large as necessary for the whole file, up to the
available RAM.  Finally, do NOT forget your password.  I can not be
responsible for attempting to unencrypt a file after you have
forgotten your password.  It _may_ be possible, but it would NOT be
easy.

2)  PRG buffer is resizable on the fly.  If you try loading a file
larger than the buffer, it will ask whether to resize the buffer or
not.  There are also new config options to play with here.  The PRG
buffer size is what it defaults to when you run Edit Plus as a PRG. 
The Minimum Free System RAM is how much memory Edit Plus will never
try to grab, no matter how big you tell it to try to make the buffer. 
So if you are running MultiTOS, you might want to increase the min
free system RAM to something much larger than the 40K default to allow
enough space for other programs to run.  Note that whatever space you
have allocated for your ACC buffer is basically wasted space when
running as a PRG, so you may want to save a different ACC buffer size
to your EDITPLUS.PRG versus your EDITPLUS.ACC file.  Note that the prg
and system sizes and some other new things are saved to the cfg file,
so the new EDITPLUS.CFG file will be larger than your EDHAK.CFG file. 
The ACC buffer size still must be saved directly to the ACC file (or
PRG file that will be run as an ACC in MultiDesk).

3)  Upper/Lower/Caps case changer (alt-E).  This operates on a
selected block.

4)  Select Everything (shift-alt-E).  This selects the entire buffer
as a block.

5)  Remove all non-text characters (shift-alt-R).  This operates on
the entire file, from the beginning of the buffer to the end of the
file, even if the file is larger than the current buffer size.  It
strips everything except ASCII 9 (tab), 10 (linefeed), 12 (formfeed),
13 (carriage return), and 32 -> 126.

6)  Print starting and ending strings are both now configurable
directly from the New config menu.  NOTE: They do not use macro #10
anymore.

7)  When loading a file larger than the buffer, you no longer get the
dialog about finding a string or picking which part of the file to
load.  Those were holdovers from when the search function could not go
beyond the current buffer contents.  Now that you can easily search
and scroll down to portions of the file beyond the original buffer
size, I thought it would be more user friendly to get rid of that
opening dialog.  Please let me know if this is badly missed.  

8)  In connection with the smoother handling of files larger than the
buffer, the vertical slider is now based on the whole file size rather
than just the buffer contents -- this allows much easier direct
scrolling to the end of a file larger than the buffer.  Using the
Shift-ClrHome command now toggles between the start and end of the
whole file, rather than just the start/end of the buffer contents. 

9)  Also connected to the revised handling of files larger than the
buffer, the line number (and byte offset in hack mode) are now
maintained relative to the start of the whole file.  To accomplish
this requires the program to do more disk accesses when shifting from
the beginning of a file to the end, since it must count every line
along the way.  If you want to edit files that are many times larger
than the buffer (due to limited RAM and/or multimegabyte files), then
having the file on a ramdisk or at least a fast hard drive will make
your life much more pleasant.  At least things have been sped up a
little by not displaying each buffer segment as it scrolls by, the way
EdHak used to do when searching through a large file.

10)  The Edit Plus menu now includes the keyboard shortcuts for each
of the commands.  (As before, see the Help screens for all the
keyboard commands.)


Fixed bugs?
