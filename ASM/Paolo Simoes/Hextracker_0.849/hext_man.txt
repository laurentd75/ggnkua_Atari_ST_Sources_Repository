This is a small guide for Hextracker(version 0.849).
====================================================

Please remember that this program will remain BETA for ever !
The author refuses any blaming for any errors detected !
This program MUST not be sold as it was given by the author to the Atari comunity.
This program should work both in colour and mono mode with a 512Kb STF/E but 1MB or more is better.
It can handle from 1 up to 16 voices but up to 8 will be better.
The user has full volume and pitch control(3 octaves) for each voice.

SONGNAME: click on the name/spaces to edit
SAMPLENAME: click on the name/spaces to edit
TEXT EDITOR:
- mouse selects edit position
- insert toggles insert/replace mode
- arrows, backspace and delete allowed
- return/enter ends editor

SONG: info size in bytes of the MOD
MEMORY: info size in bytes of the memory left
DISK: click on it to get the size available on the working disk

MESSAGE: information that may sometimes wait for space or editor key when the mouse pointer is hidden

NCHAN: set the number of voices from 1 to 16 (value in decimal)
- arrow up: increase the number os voices by 1 up to 16
- arrow down: decrease the number of voices by 1 down to 0

HEXTRACKER: shows some info about the utility

PLAY: plays the song in TRACK mode ! (numeric pad toggles voices / enter sets all)
Space stops. Return pauses and restarts.
In Record mode: left and right arrow move around the visible voices, note keys insert note, HELP/UNDO select low octave.
Play can also automaticaly stop if:
- there is not enough memory
- there is no CPU time left
- a song error is found like non existing pattern or sample
- ...

PATTERN: sets Pattern mode that will keep playing the same pattern

RECORD: will allow pressed keys to be stored in the current voice in the MOD data as if a sample was played while the MOD is played

EDIT: allows pattern data to be edited manually

The tone keys support 3 octaves with HELP/UNDO to select low octave (0/1).
The keyboard keys are the standard ones like in PT 2.1 .

PRINT: will print the MOD

C2 REF: sets the base frequency for all samples (in decimal).
Amiga PAL: 8287Hz
Amiga NTSC: 8363 Hz
Octalyser 20 KHz: 10000 Hz
Octalyser 25 KHz: 12500 Hz
If you sample a A-2 then you should sample it at C2_Ref*2^(9/12) = 13937 Hz (for Amiga PAL).
The A is 9 steps after the C-2 and 1 octave has 12 steps.
If we have a B-3 then from C-2, we have 23 steps: C2_Ref*2^(23/12) = 31288 Hz (for Amiga PAL).
Going to octave 1, the rule is the same but with negative steps.
This allows to have higher frequency (and better quality) samples.
- arrow up: increase the samples frequency by 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 up to 65535 Hz
- arrow down: decrease the samples frequency by 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 down to 100 Hz (be careful !)

OUTPUT: toggles the OUTPUT and DISK panels

OUTPUT panel:
- Arrows select output type (all except YM and STE were not tested with the HW)
  STE tested with Steem 3.2 and Hatari 1.62 !
- Click on STEREO / MONo to toggle the mode for STE
- Arrows select replay frequency (if it is too much the player will stop !)
  STE frequency possibilities are measured from your real HW !
- Arrows set the Volume/Quality factor
- DIST option will calculate the optimum V/Q factor after the complete MOD was played once.
  That value is different for mono and stereo mode and also multiplex mode.
  That value is initialized to half of the number of voices (4 voices -> 2.0)
- 8BIT option forces to use full 8 bit samples as input to the mixer (default is 7 bit samples (much faster))
- HBIT is the same as 8BIT except it uses more memory but is faster
- DATA option when selected displays the pattern data while playing and DMIN only displays one line
- V.U. option when selected displays some VU meters up to 8 channels (please notice how looped samples persist ...)
- DIGISCOPE option will display the graphical pic of the data sent to the output device
  (maximum 352 dots => 17.5 KHz (more frequency will lead to same amount of dots))
- SAMPL: selects the sample type to be loaded/saved signed or unsigned

DISK panel:
- LOAD SAMP: loads sample
- SAVE SAMP: saves sample
- LOAD MOD(or Alt/Control L): loads MOD (several formats can be imported (TCB, OKT, Protracker(s), STE Octalyser, Fast Tracker / Take Tracker))
- SAVE MOD(or Alt/Control S): saves the MOD in Hextracker format
- LOAD SONG: loads the song part and looks for the samples in the same directory
- SAVE SONG: saves the song part
- DEL FILE: delete file
- Alt/Control P: saves MOD as Protracker/Fast Tracker/Octalyser (lossy!!!)

TRACK/SAMPL: toggles TRACK and SAMPL mode that will allow a better sample size adjustment

PATTERN DATA (+ means shift or alt or control):
- left top corner: select pattern
- Mouse click to move cursor
- Arrows up, down, left, right to move around (presh shift/alt/control to go faster)
- Numpad to select sample (0 and . to select group of 16 then digit enter selects 1)
  or numbers if not in the tone column
- +Numpad to go to voice
- Clr Home to go to first pattern row
- +Clr Home to go to the pattern on first song position, first row, first voice
- Backspace goes up (and clears in Edit mode)
- Return goes down but to tone position
- Tab goes to tone position and then jumps to next voice
- +Tab goes to tone position and then to previous voice
- # to go to the first voice
- +# to go to the last voice
- Digits, A, B, C, D, E, F and delete (or shift delete) to edit
- Insert to create pattern
- +Insert to create a pattern on the first available space
- Crotchets: turn voice on/off
- Alt Space plays
- Shift space switches the current Pattern mode and plays
- Control space switches the current Record mode and plays
- Caps Lock toggles Edit mode
- Alt B to get the block info
- F1: marks start of block
- F2: marks end of block
- F3: copy marked block for the cursor voice
- F4: copy marked block from the cursor voice to the marked voice(+F1)
- F5: copy marked block from the cursor voice to all voices
- F6: copy marked block for all voices
- F7: copy marked block from the current pattern to the marked pattern(+F2) for all voices
- F8: copy cursor voice to marked voice for all patterns
- F9: - $10 positions
- F10: + $10 positions
- +F1: marks voice
- +F2: marks pattern
- +F3: switch marked voice with cursor voice for all patterns
- +F4: deletes the contents of cursor voice for all patterns
- +F5: delete row data
- +F6: clears block marked by F1 and F2 including limits but only on the cursor voice
- +F7: clears block marked by F1 and F2 including limits on all voices
- +F8: clears a pattern
- +F9: deletes a pattern
- +F10: deletes a sample
- Control + Alt + Right shift to delete all patterns
- Control + Alt + Right shift + Left shift to reset MOD

Playing will stop if an error is detected like no sample, no pattern ...

Known issues:
=============
- TCB Tracker and OKTalyser formats may be not fully read due to lack of documentation;
- Extended octaves are not supported and lead to a crash so the support of Take tracker and Fast tracker files is limited;
- BPM, finetune and update funk commands are ignored and not supported;
- Mod loading does not check for all error possibilities in the file;
- Some issues with memory not restored with load/save sample;
- Config.inf file is for a QWERTY keyboard !!! (128 bytes without shift + 128 bytes with)
- Mixing routs have been built for STF so for STE Lance's player is much better for 4 voices MODs (twice faster);

Have fun,
Paulo.

Annex3:	Mixing details
======================

YM ouputs or DIST active or Digiscope active:
---------------------------------------------

- 7-bit or 8-bit sample data is volumed and mixed into 12-bit buffers;
- 12 bit mixed data is squeezed down to the ouput bits according to the amplification factor;
- volume table resolution depends on the number of mixed voices:
-- 1 voice 12-bit; (2 stereo or mono multiplex /4 stereo multiplex)
-- 2 voices 11-bit; (4 stereo or mono multiplex /8 stereo multiplex)
-- 3 voices 10.4-bit; (6 stereo or mono multiplex /12 stereo multiplex)
-- 4 voices 10-bit; (8 stereo or mono multiplex /16 stereo multiplex)
-- 5 voices 9.7-bit; (10 stereo or mono multiplex)
-- 6 voices 9.4-bit; (12 stereo or mono multiplex)
-- 7 voices 9.2-bit; (14 stereo or mono multiplex)
-- 8 voices 9-bit; (16 stereo or mono multiplex)
-- 9 voices 8.83-bit;
-- 10 voices 8.68-bit;
-- 11 voices 8.54-bit;
-- 12 voices 8.42-bit;
-- 13 voices 8.30-bit;
-- 14 voices 8.19-bit;
-- 15 voices 8.09-bit;
-- 16 voices 8-bit;

No YM and DIST and Digiscope inactive:
--------------------------------------

- 7-bit or 8-bit sample data is volumed and mixed into 14-bit buffers;
- 14 bit mixed data is squeezed down to the ouput bits according to the amplification factor;
- All the values above for volumed data get 2 more bits !!! :)

DIST and Digiscope could work also like the rest but i would need much bigger tables :D
