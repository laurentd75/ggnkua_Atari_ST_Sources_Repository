How to compile and use PASSWORD.S

First format a blank disk, and copy PASSWORD.IS, HIDE_IT.IS and SHOW_IT.IS 
to the root directory. Open the ASSEMBLE folder on the GFA disk that 
came with ST Format, June 92 issue, and copy GFA- ASM.PRG to your 
work disk. Finally copy your diary, or whichever program you want 
to protect, over to the disk. All your programs should be in the root 
directory, do not put any in any folders. Double-click on GFA-ASM.PRG 
to get it started. once it's up and running you should see the names 
of the three .IS listings towards the top left of the screen. Double_click 
on PASSWORD IS, and you will be taken to a new screen, displaying 
the listing. This can be used in one of two ways. If you wish to have 
a program that hides text files, for instance a letter you don't want 
anyone to see, or the file that your diary program uses to store your 
diary's details, then change the line that reads:
program	equ	-1	
to:
program	equ	0	 If you wish to hide a program, and not let any one 
else run it unless they know the password, then leave the line as:
program	equ	-1
Now use the cursor keys to move to the bottom of the listing, where 
you should find the lines:
filename: .Dc.b	"MY_DIARY.PRG",0
pass:	.Dc.b	"st format",0
The first of these lines gives the program to be run, or the text 
to be hidden. This needs to be altered to give the name of your program 
or text. So if you want to hide a file called LETTER.TXT, simply change 
this line to:
filename: .Dc.b	"LETTER.TXT",0
The second line gives the password; to use another password, eg to 
my password, change this to:
pass:	.Dc.b	"my password",0
If your password is more than 16 cahracters long, then go to the top 
of the listing again, and alter the 16 in:
buff_len equ 16
to a number that is bigger than your password's length.
Now click the right mouse button. The menu at the top should change, 
and at the far right is the word "Assembler". Move the mouse pointer 
over this to highlight it and a menu will pop down. Move the mouse 
to highlight the second option, "f2: Assembler...". Click the left 
mouse button. Click on the box containing the instruction "Start with 
new Name", and a box will open up containing the line "PROGRAM : A:\PASSWORD". 
Press <Return> and your program should compile. Press <Return> again 
when you see the OK box.
Click the right mouse button again, highlight the word File at the 
top left, and when the menu drops down, click on "f5: Load New..."
load HIDE_IT.IS by double-clicking on it. Again, alter the line
filename: .Dc.b	"MY_DIARY.PRG",0
as before. Now highlight the Assembler menu as before, and follow 
the same procedure to compile the program, although this time. after 
"Start wih new Name", change the "PROGRAM :A:\PASSWORD" line to "PROGRAM 
:A:\HIDE_IT".
Repeat all this for the SHOW_IT.IS file; remember to change "PROGRAM 
:A:\HIDE_IT" to "PROGRAM :A:\SHOW_IT".
Finally highlight the File menu, and choose Quit.
After all that hard work, you should now have, if there's any justice 
in the world, three more programs on your disk, HIDE_IT.PRG, SHOW_IT.PRG, 
and PASSWORD.PRG. Double click on HIDE_IT.PRG, having made sure the 
write-protect is no on, and after a few seconds, you will find that 
your program or text file has disappeared. Don't be alarmed, it's 
still there, double click on SHOW_IT.PRG if you need reassurance. 
Having hidden your file or program in this way, double-click on PASSWORD.PRG, 
and you will be prompted to enter your password. If you get it right, 
and it needs to have the right case for each letter so check your 
<Caps Lock> key, then either your hidden program will run, or you 
will be returned to the Desktop where your selected file will have 
reappeared.
Be careful that you keep backups of your files, as we cannot be held 
responsible if you lose any valuable data. And don't forget your password.
