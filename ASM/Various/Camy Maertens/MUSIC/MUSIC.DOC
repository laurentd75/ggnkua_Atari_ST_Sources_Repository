Gary Wheaton and The Shapeshifters
----------------------------------

The Shapeshifters' music is now well known to Budgie
followers.
Gary has written more than twenty tunes for the ST,
all hand-coded, all accessing the sound chip direct.

In this folder, you'll find lisa_14.prg ,lynne_15.prg,
la_8.prg and scary_2.prg.

Also included (a real bonus for 68000 programmers), is the
original source code.   Full credit will be expected if these
tunes are used in your games.
If you want any of the other tunes, write to Gary Wheaton
(address within source code), or to Budgie UK, preferrably
enclosing an order for one of the Shapeshifters games. (2.95 ea)

The music code is slotted in one of the vertical blank slots.
It is therefore running at either 50hz or 60hz depending on
the monitor you use.

The actual slot is $4de (one of the highest, and therefore safest,
slots in the v/b queue).

Within your programs, the v/b routine is toggled on/off by
poking zero (long) in $200,  and disabled completely by
poking zero (long) in $4de.

From the keyboard, toggle is 'HELP', disable is 'UNDO'.
