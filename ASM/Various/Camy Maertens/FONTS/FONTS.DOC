FONTS
-----

These GEM fonts are used by several of the programs on this disk.

A1 fonts are 8*16, large size fonts.
A2 fonts are 8*8, standard size.

To take full advantage of these fonts, you should use the
INCREDIBLE 'fontsel.acc' by Jeremy Hughes.

This accessory is public domain and is available from ST CLUB
and most good PD libraries. It is essential. It works with
First Word+, GenST, Data Manager, Tempus, VIP and a host of
other programs.

The full FONTKIT+ program is available for a reasonable price
from ST CLUB, Nottingham.
