
N_LIGHT.PRG

This program install a new Rwabs routine; each time a non-floppy device is
activated it will switch on the floppy A light. You'll be able to see any
disk I/O even if your hard disk does nopt provide such a light. Even the
activities of RAM disks is shown.

Install this program in your AUTO folder or start it from the desktop.
If you install it in your AUTO folder make sure it is activated after
RAM disk programs, otherwise you won't see their activity. A message
appears at booting time. If you start N_LIGHT form the desktop, it will
show a alertbox, asking whether you want to install the program or quit.

The new Rwabs vector is installed with XBRA id NFL1. N_LIGHT stays
resident in memory, but uses only 350 bytes.

This little program is based on DCFLIGHT.PRG by Keith Gerdes & Michael
B. Vederman (Double Click Software). I wrote this program as a challenge
to achieve the same result, and it worked. It is 280 bytes smaller than
DCFLIGHT, and it even uses the XBRA protocol. I am SO proud of it that
I included the assembly source!

This program and this source are strictly PD; they may not be sold and
they may not be changed without permission. Use it at your own risk.
