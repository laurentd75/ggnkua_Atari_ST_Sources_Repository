     Well, I'm back again  with  another piece  of code.  This  one is  a 
Scroller route which took me 8-9 hours to do.  It has originated from the 
code By Monst of  the  FCC on  ledgers  6.  Now  the  routine  is  almost 
completely different.  It is know faster, than the small font, when using 
a 16*16 font, but not as fast scroller.  With this document should  be an 
almost full commented piece of code.  It's commented for learners, 'cause 
obviously the more expierienced would probably find the`is code Pi** easy 
to understand.  Well thats it really.  My  address is below.  If your not 
of a well known Demo crew, then remember  to  include an   S.A.E. if  you 
write.  If  your Demo Crew  is looking for members, then also contact me. 
OVER AND OUT !!
