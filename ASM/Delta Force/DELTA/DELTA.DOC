DELTA.PRG
---------

This is a splendid scroller, raster interrupt, music driver.

The main program originally came from DELTA FORCE, hence the name.
Budgie added the Shapeshifters' music, slotted an ascii text
facility and re-arranged the mfp colours.

This program is ideal to use as a loader. But watch the memory:
it gobbles up vast amount of bytes in code, character set, music,
header, ascii text, etc...
All programs that write to the video sync register at $ff820a 
in order to toggle the 50/60 hz modes are liable to de-stabilize
the colour generation. It is therefore advisable, before running
delta.prg, raster_5.prg, and such programs, to SWITCH OFF the
computer for a full 15 seconds.

The file with the ascii message is called 'text.asc'
The message should end with a | in order to wrap around.

Use Devpac2 to change colours or even header.
Users without Devpac2 (are there any?), can modify the colours
by using a disk editor (DISK DOCTOR), and modifying the delta.prg
itself. Colours are recognisable by their range: $0000 to $0777.
But make a copy first...
